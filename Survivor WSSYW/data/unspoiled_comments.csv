It was a legit social experiment, designed to see what would happened if you just dumped people on an island and watched.

I didn't like the twist, because it screwed over someone I liked in the season, but that didn't take away from it at all.

I watched the season knowing the final 4 and the final 2, and I was still shocked at some tribal councils, so it's worth a re-watch if you haven't seen it in a while.",2
7.0,"Pearl
Islands",c6he404,"The best season. 

I think only Cook Islands comes close to having such an all-star cast. Rupert, Sandra, Andrew, Johnny Fairplay: there are just so many people with large personalities. 

Hands down the best premiere in the show's history.

It also has *the* funniest event in Survivor history(I honestly do not think anything will ever top the trick that pulled in episode 11.)

I remember every player in this season. I could recite them to you in the order they went without looking it up. And I've only seen the season once!

The only reason to not watch this season right now is if you are doing them in order (the best way).

If I absolutely, **absolutely** can't convince you to watch the seasons in order, then watch Pearl Islands immediately. To be more specific:

* The characters are outstanding
* The gameplay is outstanding
* The location is outstanding
* The challenges, events and everything else is outstanding
* Probably the best first episode of any season. (I'll disagree, but understand if anybody thinks HvV's one was better)

And above all, do not let this one get spoiled for you. It's unpredictable as fuck and losing that would be a terrible shame.

That is not the case for the first 8 seasons, and that is ESPECIALLY not the case for Marquesas. This season is in my opinion the second most important as far as developing the game goes, and the most greatly diminished by watching out of order.

Events that unfold in this season are very exciting in context but substantially less so after watching later seasons. A lot of people love the cast, but a lot of people don't, so if you watch it after seeing the later seasons, you're really gambling on that for whether you enjoy it.

Overall, the cast is either intelligent, very fun to watch, or both, so the potential is there and it has a lot of really good moments, but it's only worth giving a serious watch if you like strong strategic players, and even then the aforementioned bad decisions drag down the strategy aspect a lot. 

My post looks really negative reading it back but for some reason I love Fiji a lot, which is why I took the time to write that out at all instead of upvoting and moving on.

15.0,China,crlhp8s,"I just finished rewatching China the other day, so it's fresh in my mind. As /u/PopsicleIncorporated mentioned, it's a fantastic season to introduce people to Survivor (though Cagayan might have usurped that title due to more modern, relevant gameplay). 

China had an amazing location/theme with some really high production values, probably the biggest in the show's history. In addition, the rewards are awesome, allowing certain castaways to visit the Great Wall and even the legendary Shaolin Temple (how they managed to wrangle that, I have no idea). Take a look at China's rewards and contrast that to today's cut-and-paste ""helicopter tour and some food"" rewards and feel very jealous.

In terms of the gameplay, I wouldn't call it crazy by any means, certainly not matching the frenetic pace of Heroes vs. Villains or Cagayan, but the boot order was never predictable enough for the game to get boring. Had just the right amount of ""shockers"", both premerge and postmerge, to make for good viewing. 

Casting was on point in this season. It was a genuinely likable cast who clearly enjoyed each other's company (even though some of them said otherwise). Even the season's ""villain"" was funny in a good way. China's given us three returnees so far (two of which have played three times each) and will be giving us a fourth come S31. Another few people not included in those four probably deserve a second shot, too.

The eventual winner's performance at FTC in front of the jury was probably the single best in the show's history. Only the Vanuatu winner's FTC performance comes close.",17
15.0,China,crlfort,"Perfect blend of old and new. Idol strategy mixed with a huge location theme. My favorite season. If you want to get someone into Survivor, this is it. ",24
15.0,China,crlf1s3,IMO the strongest newbie cast in terms of characters from top to bottom. Keeps your interest the entire way through.,7
15.0,China,crljgor,"It's the season past season 10 that feels the most like an original season-for the good in this case. Very strong and likable cast with just the right amount of unpredictablity and gameplay. Not the most flashy season, but I and most other people really enjoy it.",2
15.0,China,crlkf2k,"Great characters, some stellar strategic moments, a really cool location, and the best FTC ever. Just a solid season all-around. I feel like it's especially popular right now on this subreddit because of an especially popular contestant in the reddit-sphere that's returning for S31.",4
15.0,China,crllq08,"The best season for a newbie to watch, more so than Cagayan. The reason for this is because there is plenty of strategy to follow, but also because the social game plays a huge part in determining the winner and the path of the game.

It also displays Survivor less as a competition, but more as an experience. You get to feel the sense of adventure that modern seasons often lack or downplay. However, it doesn't do so by sacrificing interesting play, it just presents the game play in a succinct way that allows for speculation and intrigue while it also manages to devote screentime to things going on at rewards and around camp. This is why it's often called a blend of old and new styles. I don't know if I particularly agree with that, because to me nothing past S10 ever felt like the first 10 (aside from maybe parts of Philippines) but that's not necessarily a bad thing, as my average ranking for seasons 9-20 is actually slightly better than it is for 1-8.

Anyway, China is 11/30 but I do think that it is probably the best place to start for someone new, aside from maybe Australian Outback or Amazon.",3
15.0,China,crlnlrx,"Like Amazon, this season ranks kind of low on my list. Like Amazon's ranking, this is just me being weird and stupid and you should ignore it. I have a hard time getting into the cast here, but most people freaking love this cast. It's absolutely a breath of fresh air after 13/14, with waaaaay less dumb twists and pretty much nobody getting the totally irrelevant edit. It has a great location, it has exciting moments, it has lots of likable and memorable contestants... It's one of the most well-rounded seasons, and I have nothing to complain about.

It wouldn't be the first one that I'd suggest to start someone at, because season one exists (and even aside from chronology, that one has never failed me in getting someone into the show.) But as far as China itself goes, it's definitely a strong season with no real holes or weirdness that contains pretty much everything that's good about the show. So *if* you want to start with a much later season in the show's run, then this one would almost certainly be be your best bet - this one or Gabon.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 16/27

**Overall verdict:** Well-rounded season that's good at everything and bad at nothing. If you're going to start with modern Survivor (which, again, not really my recommendation because that's just sort of ignoring years and years of the show - but *if!* you disagree with me there), then this is probably the second-best place to start next to Gabon.

15.0,China,crlrdfp,">(though Cagayan might have usurped that title due to more modern, relevant gameplay).

See for me that's one big reason why I *wouldn't* start with Cagayan. It has both feet in the post-modern Survivor camp, while China and Gabon sort of straddle that line. I don't think going with the most recent season is the best way to get someone into the whole franchise.

15.0,China,cv6vwif,"I am (or at least I was) a fan of the MTV Real World Challenges, and when I heard that they were about to rip off a bloodlines theme from Survivor for their upcoming season, I decided to check out Survivor for the first time ever. I quickly watched through Blood vs Water, and I got a decent taste for the show. While I wasn't crazy about it right away, my interest had been piqued enough to where I thought I'd check out another season. The next one I saw was Cagayan; it was enough to get me hooked and become a hardcore fan. I've since gone back and watched every season in chronological order over the past few months, with Thailand being the only one that I couldn't complete once it got to the post-merge. 

I'm now starting One World, so I haven't seen anything between S24 and S27, but I agree that Cagayan is one of the best seasons ever, and is especially good for attracting newer fans. That being said, the amount of strategic depth to Cagayan might make it really tough for new viewers to then go back and watch some older seasons like Australia and Gabon. I almost ripped my hair out when I went from Cagayan straight to Borneo.",1

In many ways, it probably is, but then again, its good moments are really, really great. I personally think the season is a good one to begin with because it has clear-cut, easy-to-follow storylines and strategy, but I think it lacks some of the subtlety and nuance of the seasons that I prefer.

I have Cagayan ranked as 16/30 which is considerably lower than what I've heard from other people. I think it is a little too in-your-face and doesn't leave as much room for speculation or interpretation, but that is one of its few criticisms while in almost every other way it is universally praised.",3
28.0,Cagayan,crlqjer,"I do need to rewatch this one to iron down my specific ranking of it and whatnot. My current impression of this season, though, is that it's a pretty entertaining one and a high point in recent Survivor - but not a good one to start with. A lot of the focus here does sort of revolve around strategy, Idols, and ""big moves"" - and the winner is given a reaaaally inaccurate edit that doesn't quite get into how and why they actually won. I think that if you start with this season, you'll have a really warped view of what Survivor is and how and why contestants win it. And of course, I just don't think it particularly makes sense to start watching a show with its *28th* season after almost a decade and a half of changes.

I do think it's a pretty good season. I was very pleased with most of it - though some parts of the post-merge reaaaaally disappointed me and felt like flashbacks to season 22 or 26. Overall, though, I do think it was a pretty strong collection of episodes involving a pretty strong cast; I don't think it's one of the best seasons, but it is pretty entertaining.

Still, I really wouldn't start with it - even if it's the most popular one on this sub, that doesn't mean it's really the best or most accurate introduction to Survivor as a whole. I think that if you start with this one, you'll get a kind of warped view of what Survivor is or should be, and I think that that'd really hinder your enjoyment of some other seasons, particularly the earliest ones. It's worth watching, it's worth watching relatively early if you decide that you want to start with modern and post-modern seasons... but I definitely, definitely don't think it's a good one to start off with. To start with this one, I think, heavily misrepresents the franchise and will impair your enjoyment of other earlier seasons.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** n/a because I need to rewatch, but somewhere around #12 or so

**Overall verdict:** Fun season, but doesn't really represent what the franchise often is or can be and will probably leave you with a bit of a warped view on what Survivor is. Starting with this one would kind of ignore and screw over a lot of Survivor history, so I'd say start with some earlier ones, and if you still don't like them, maybe then move on to this one. Because it's very good modern Survivor, but.. it's also very modern Survivor, and therefore, starting with it will make you assume that's what the show always is and probably not be interested in the earliest seasons, which is doing the show and its history a bit of a disservice.

(edit months later: Upon rewatching Cag, I wouldn't describe it as ""very good modern Survivor."" Editing is way out of whack at some points, there are a few straight episodes where basically nothing happens, and I'd rank it around #18-20. Other than the premiere - which is fantastic - literally every aspect of it underwhelmed me on the rewatch and I was unpleasantly surprsied.)",2

7.0,"Pearl
Islands",crlliqc,"Holy hell I love this season. I just fucking love it.

OK, so get this: The most iconic villain and most iconic hero of the franchise both make their debut right here in this season. Not to mention the inclusion of an anti-hero who wins almost as many contestant rankings as Pearl Islands does season rankings. And yet those three, who could take *all* the airtime from the other 15 and still make a good season don't even make up half of the memorable contestants from here.

Not really actually. Because Pearl Islands wins just about every season ranking. As it should. It has a fucking awesome theme and a fucking awesome cast and everything plays out absolutely perfectly. The pirate theme in particular, in addition to suiting the personalities of the cast really well, integrated seamlessly into the gameplay as well as visual design. It's truly a great effort on all fronts of production here.

I get that some people don't like early survivor. Season 7 might seem a bit too early for you. But if you want to confirm whether you don't like early survivor or not, this is the season to do it with. As far as I'm concerned, if you don't like Pearl Islands you might as well turn your back on all the seasons before it as well.

So, while I think it's flawless, in the interests of being fair, I'll mention a few things people perceive as drawbacks. It does have a twist. I can't say much on it, but people don't like it. In principle I agree with them. But the season is vastly improved by it, so overall, the twist turns out to be a fantastic fluke by production. There are some characters people hate, one of whom goes pre-merge and one who makes it a fair way, both of whom I absolutely adore and consider both funny and interesting. But they're there, and you might lean more towards dislike.

Back to the good. What I would call the single best thing to happen in survivor is in this season. What I would call the single best premiere episode is in this season. What I would call the single best survivor character ever is in this season. And of course, my favourite episode of the whole series is here as well.

Do I recommend it? Well the way I see it, there are three ways a person who hasn't seen Pearl Islands can decide what to watch: There's the way where they go in order and just get to it when it's time comes, there's the way where they jump straight to it because they don't care about order and thus shoot straight for the best and there's the *wrong* way where they do literally anything else and it makes no sense.

Best season ever. 100/100. Watch it. Love it. Make a post here talking about it afterwards. I'll see you then.",17
7.0,"Pearl
Islands",crlfi0p,"If you're looking at things from a meta perspective, Pearl Islands was the culmination of everything that happened in the first six seasons of the show. We continued to see the development of modern strategy with some moves that were considered shocking at the time but now would be a no-brainer. Alliances were formed and then betrayed. Temporary partnerships united previous enemies to complete a specific task, after which they immediately dissolved.

Production values of the season were quite high. Pearl Islands had the single best theme of the entire series: Pirates! And *man*, did they stick to it - the great majority of the challenges were tied into piracy in some way. Furthermore, the season's music was fantastic, probably the show's peak, and really helped add to the theme.

If you don't care about viewing things through a meta lens, Pearl Islands is also just a damn good season of Survivor to watch. A big reason for this is the storyline. The show is basically divided into several different arcs, each of which is easily digestible. By the time of the jury phase the editors have done their job well enough where you're rooting against one particular alliance (and one person specifically) with every fiber of your being. The fact that this person put down the single greatest lie in Survivor history certainly helps.

Finally, the main reason for Pearl Islands's excellence: The players. Obviously you had the huge personalities, but bigger than that was that everybody got a balanced edit. A person who left somewhat ignominiously pre-merge still had his/her motivations explored, whereas in the modern day they would have received a much more negative/invisible treatment. And in terms of the players that actually *mattered*... let's just say that their actions still reverberate through the Survivor metagame even today, up through and including another consensus top-5 season Heroes vs. Villains. There's a reason that the show is bringing somebody from Pearl Islands back for S31.

The one drawback to Pearl Islands is that about halfway through the game there's an extremely controversial twist, which was totally out of nowhere and unfair. That said, in the end the aftereffects of this twist probably added to the drama later on.

In short, watch it. There's a reason why Pearl Islands is right at the top of this list.",27

I had seen its returnees play in later seasons, and I had heard about the legendary moments and moves, so I went into S7 expecting those moments and moves to be less effective due to the lack of surprise.  But this season just delivers.  It is like watching Jordan, Messi, or Manning excel at their sport.

Let's blow this one out of the fucking park"", and succeeded even beyond their own wildest dreams.

Most of the time, I'll explain my opinions super in-depth. But sometimes, absolutely nothing that I or anyone else could ever say could possibly compare to the thing itself. Pearl Islands, the pinnacle of Survivor, is one such time.

So I'm not even going to elaborate. I'm not going to say one word about what makes Pearl Islands so great. Just watch it. Go into it knowing as little as you can, and bask in the overwhelming wonder and beauty and perfection that is almost unequivocally Survivor's greatest season.

*(That said, I don't think it should be your first one. Even outside of the chronological order, my support for which I will always wave in your face, I think starting with Pearl Islands is a pretttttty bad idea.

GO WATCH IT SO YOU CAN CIRCLEJERK WITH THE REST OF US LIKE A NORMAL SURVIVOR GEEK! (...after you watch 1-6 maybe \^_\^)

Islands",crm7vaw,"Pearl Islands is the crown jewel of survivor.  If someone is a fan of survivor but not a fan of Pearl Islands then I honestly don't understand why they like survivor.  This season offers everything you could want in a season.  One of the best casts the show has ever had with no less than three iconic players, and many other very memorable ones.  The best premier episode of any season.  Two episodes (not including the premier) which I would have in my top ten episodes of all time.  Not only a great pirate theme but one they stick with all the way through twists, challenges, the music, etc.  One of the best final challenges.

I think this is the perfect blend between camp life/survival and strategy.  Which really lets a lot of characters have their moments.  It's an earlier season so it's a different strategy than more recent seasons since there are no idols.  But there is still lot's of strategy it's cut throat, unpredictable, and some times outside the box.  I just can't say enough good things about this season.  It's literally the best.",3

25.0,Philippines,crlpmbc,"(**RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!!:** Contains players from seasons 2, 13, 16, and 19, and contains very direct spoilers for some major moments from those seasons.)

Philippines was SO FUCKING AWESOME to watch live after 22-24. On the rewatch, it did go down for me a little bit. The first four episodes are so, SO good, but I think it loses a lot of steam after that, and I think the post-merge should have been edited waaaay differently. I'm also not too interested in its major protagonist or antagonist, so that's part of it.

Some big problems with the storytelling prevent me from ranking this one too high, but it's still a largely agreeable season, definitely worth watching at some point, a fine addition to the pool of Survivor seasons. But I think there are many better seasons and that it might not be received *as* positively if more people rewatched seasons, since I've seen its reputation go down dramatically even in the time since it aired.

In any case, though, don't start with this one, because it has maaajor spoilers for previous seasons, and some of its big stories are more satisfying when you know who those players are.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 15/27

**Overall verdict:** Solid season that's worth watching, but I think it's better right after 22-24 and should have been edited way differently. It's pretty good but I don't think it's the standout many people do or see any real reason to jump at this one compared to many other modern seasons - particularly when there are returning players. Definitely way more satisfying and less spoiler-y when you've seen its returning players' original seasons.",7

Fun season that I rank relatively high. I don't revere it as the awesome godly standout some people do, but I still think it's really fun, so I rank it pretty high.

**BUT!:** The things that I rank it high for are largely the continuations of previous seasons' storylines. This season just will not be nearly as enjoyable if you haven't seen previous seasons to know who these contestants actually are.

To fully familiarize yourself with this cast, I think you need to watch seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (1/3 aren't represented here, but they definitely are majorly represented in S8 All-Stars, which is a must-view before this one), 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19.

But here, people *freaking love Tocantins.* I don't really know what about it makes it more popular here than elsewhere, or what about /r/survivor makes them like it more.

I think it's a pretty agreeable season, though, with not many underedited contestants, a largely old-school format, a very satisfying boot order and winner/F2, and lots of good characters. I really don't have any distinct complaints about it. I don't think it should be the *first* season you watch because one contestant in particular is just so fucking unlike anything that appears on most other seasons. But if you're not going in order, I do think Tocantins is a good second or third season to check out, for sure. I don't think that it really stands out, but I think that it's consistently entertaining and plays out in a good way - which will suck you even further into the franchise before the major standout ones. I wouldn't say to *start* with it, but if you're interested in starting with more modern ones, I'd say it's a good one to watch *early.*

12.0,Panama,crlmukl,"Panama is my pick for the all-time funniest Survivor season - though 17 and 21 could give it a run for its money. One of its two tribes (you'll be able to tell which one pretttttttty quickly) is maybe the single most revered tribe in Survivor fandom, and ""revered"" isn't an exaggeration. Pretty much all the best, wackiest, most dynamic characters ended up on one tribe by sheer happenstance, which gives us enough hilarity throughout the season to overshadow some of the kind of awkward and unnecessary twists. (With its format and twists, I think Panama *should* have been kinda awful - but it turned out to be too fucking hilarious to be awful.)

If you're more into strategy, Panama provides that as well. It births a contestant who's widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of Survivor - and they also happen to be maybe the most likable character of the season, an absolutely perfect combination. Their journey alone would make the whole season worth watching even if it *weren't* fucking hilarious besides that... so when you add all of that together, you have a season that ranked in my top 10 until very recently, ranks in very many people's, and is generally just an entertaining season. That I think 10 seasons are better just speaks to the overall quality of this franchise.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 11/27

It's fun, it's exciting, and it's especially unlike anything that came before it; if you watch seasons 1 through 5 before it, you'll probably love it even more.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 17/27

**Overall verdict**: Fun, exciting, unpredictable. Just generally agreeable Survivor that's pretty easy to sit down, watch, and really, really enjoy, and certainly a season worth viewing.",3

Not to mention this was the first season having intense cutthroat game and first season to be completely unpredictable and really changed the Survivor methodology.

Personally I would say the Amazon was one of the best back to back season along with Pearl Islands and I would have the Amazon as 2nd best Survivor season of all time after Pearl Islands.",1

Interesting cast and it is an interesting take on Survivor that you rarely see today. Focuses a lot on the Survival aspect and is just very interesting to watch.

Palauish, to avoid spoilers, to be a good introduction to the show. But once you're into the show a bit, watch it. It's definitely, *deffffinitely* a high point of the franchise with some shocking, compelling, emotional storylines and entertaining characters, a very popular/respected winner, probably the best challenges ever in Survivor (I don't give a shit about challenges 9 times out of 10 and I *still* love Palau's), and a brilliant overall theme that helps to set it apart from other ones. I think it also benefits even more from a second viewing.

**Overall verdict**: Again, I don't want to run the risk of spoiling, so I can't say much here. But I'll just say that it's one of my absolute favorites, it's a totally brilliant season with a lot of great stuff, and you won't regret watching it.

17.0,Gabon,crlo7ct,"A lot of the comments will call Gabon a ""trainwreck season"", and I think that that's sort of accurate but sort of not. It's accurate in that it has a pretty freaking great assortment of weird, weird contestants doing some weird, weird, and hilariously self-destructive things.

But it's not like those contestants are unlikable; it's not the Fiji kind of trainwreck. And it's not a trainwreck that's hard to follow with things changing all the time, so it isn't one you should be deterred from watching. I think it might be more accurately described as a cartoon, full of funny contestants hurting themselves in funny ways, than a trainwreck. And furthermore, the season's core narrative and winner are really, *really* satisfying for a first-time viewer. I think part of what makes Gabon great is that it works on two levels: you can pay attention to it deeply with more knowledge of the franchise and see how fucking weird some of its stuff is, or you can just watch it not knowing much about the show, find someone to root for, and be happy with how it ends.

But what really makes Gabon great is that the cast is just fucking **FUN** - and edited well. This cast is actually my third-favorite in Survivor history, after Borneo and Marquesas.. so basically, I think this season is actually totally on par with some of the earliest seasons in terms of how its story is told and how character-driven it is. It has a lot of new-school stuff in terms of twists, but I think it's at heart kind of an old-school season whose focus is really on the personalities and how they interact. There are SO many little character moments that I end up catching more I'd forgotten about or never noticed every single time I watch it, and I've seen it like 4 or 5 times by now.

In that sense, I think that this season perfectly blends older and newer Survivor, and **this** season is **definitely the one that I'd recommend to start with if you don't start with Borneo** (though of course it can't hurt to try Borneo first then move on to this one if you don't like it.) Again, suggesting that someone start out at a point in a show after 16 seasons and nearly a decade of television feels pretty strange... but this season honestly doesn't feel altogether like modern Survivor, and I think it's very much at home within the original 7 - while containing some elements of the newer seasons, making it an excellent gateway.

So yeah, if you're not going to start at Borneo? I'd say definitely definitely definitely start here; China's also a good choice, but I think this one is maybe better. This season is super, super easy to watch and enjoy, it's incredibly fun - but not in a Micronesia way where it's just all shocking twists; it's driven by its super fun, colorful, *diverse* collection of characters ranging from a pro Smash Bros player to an Olympic athlete to an emotionally unstable pin-up model to a guy who films weddings but hates marriage and is pretty much human Grumpy Cat. Maybe the most accessible and fun out of all 30 seasons Survivor has had, and stands the test of time even on multiple rewatches.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 7/27

**Overall verdict:** Again, it's probably the most accessible and fun season, due to having some more modern elements while also being driven by a diverse collection of utterly brilliant characters. A really, really good starting point if you're not inclined to start at the original. The absolute highlight of modern Survivor.",6

17.0,Gabon,cx3ec87,This was an oddball season. It was entertaining in its own Lord of the Flies way but it's not the most representative of the show and so definitely not an introductory season. Watch it after you've seen a few traditional seasons and want to get weird.,1

Only Pearl Islands tops Borneo in my book.",18
1.0,Borneo,crlmh72,"#I super strongly recommend that people start with this season and watch in order.

Honestly, I kinda have a problem with the whole conversation piece of ""I want to watch old seasons - so which ones are the best?"" Not that I blame people for asking it, or for answering it, but I just don't agree with the idea of watching based on which ones people say are ""the best."" And here's why, because I say it all the time on here but haven't ever *fully* delved into it:

* **There really is no objective ""the best"":** different people like and dislike different seasons, and **you don't know who you're going to agree with** until you watch them. There are probably some general trends, true, like odds are season twenty-two isn't going to be your favorite, and you're probably going to like season ten more than season twenty-four. But outside of the super extreme examples of really, really popular and unpopular seasons - as far as the middle, *most seasons,* go - opinions vary wildly (and they even do at the extremes for some people.) So if you say ""Hey, which seasons are the best?"", you're really just asking ""Which seasons happen to be popular among the people in this particular community who decided to look at and contribute to this particular thread?"" - which might not be indicative of what you'll end up agreeing with.

* If you go into a certain season knowing most people don't like it because you saved it for last or whatever, you're probably never really going to give it a fair shot, and ***every single* season has at least *something* that might be worth watching and has some defenders.** But **if you go into it assuming it'll suck,** then... your viewing experience will probably kinda suck.

* **I think it's kind of a spoiler in itself to say ""Oh this season is great! It's so unpredictable!""** Then you go into that season knowing that the dynamics are probably going to change at some point, that there'll be a major blindside of the person who seems to be in power or whatever. If you go in having no idea what'll happen either way, having no idea what people think and why, then it'll be the ultimate state of unspoiled-ness - you'll be a totally unspoiled blank slate. **And then when you end up watching one of the really freaking crazy seasons, you'll be like :OOO because you had no idea that they were going to be an unpredictable one.** When you watch a season live as it airs, you have virtually no idea whether it'll be good or bad; watching in an objective chronological order that isn't defined by ""good"" or ""bad"" recreates this experience.

* Context enhances every single season. Every single season is more powerful, for better or worse, when you can compare it to those that came around and came before it. **This is especially prevalent in the earliest seasons:** watching season 18 before season 17, when new kinds of strategy and dynamics have pretty much been locked down, probably won't matter that much. But watching season 26 before season 2 definitely does; even watching season 4 before 3 does.

* **The early seasons are a really different show than the most recent ones,** and you'll probably **enjoy that show more if you watch it first**... and enjoy the more recent show more if you've seen the previous seasons that laid its foundation. (This isn't to say ""Oh, the show was kind of okay at first but then it got REALLY good! So watch the mediocre early ones before you get spoiled by how great the show eventually is!"" or anything like that; I think all the best seasons were the earliest ones. But they're good in a kind of way that's sometimes harder to appreciate when you're only accustomed to later ones.)

If you're *totally* sure that you're not going to watch a bunch of Survivor and you're just into it morecasually (which probably isn't the case for many people spending their time looking at a thread on here), and if you're gonna watch a few seasons then check out, then maybe it makes more sense to go with some of the most popular ones (although even then, for my money, 1-4 and 7 are the best in the franchise... but, of course, that's just my opinion.) Even then, though, I'd say whichever ones you're going to watch, it probably makes sense to watch them in order.

But if you have any interest in *really* getting into the franchise, if you think that there's *any* chance that you might get really into the show and watch most or all of its seasons to date? (And I think that, if you're particularly interested in Survivor, you should totally watch every season, even though that takes longer; there are two that I personally would 100% skip and wish I hadn't sat through, but even they have their fans, and you might agree with them and not with me.) Then you should definitely, *deffffinitely* go for the full, chronological order that enhances every season, doesn't give you pre-conceived notions, and helps you really understand the development of the franchise.

And hell **even if you're only gonna watch a few seasons, I can't really think of any reason *not* to try the first one first.** As I'm gonna outline in just a sec, I think it's pretty fucking gr8 even on its own. If you don't enjoy it and you were looking for something more like the recent seasons, well, **no loss, you can move on to them** - but if you do, then you can keep watching the older ones that most people appreciate more when they're watched earliest.

So for sosososo*soooo* many reasons, I think that everyone who thinks there's *any* chance of themselves really getting into the show should watch every season in order. And I think that even people who won't get too into the show should at least start with 1.

#Now, even aside from all of that:

Even as a standalone viewing experience and leaving aside all the context and stuff, for those who might not watch much of the show? I still think this season is *totally* a **must-watch** one. It isn't just some weird dull historical thing that you should watch for the sake of enjoying later seasons more, at all; **it's some fucking fantastic television, and if I had to pick just one season to show somebody and they'd never see any other season ever, I would, utterly without question, pick this one.** Its **story** plays out in a brilliant way that's told beautifully, and along the way you get some of the biggest, best, funnest, most memorable moments and scenes of the franchise to date - culminating in perhaps the single biggest and greatest moment in the entire history of the show.

**The cast is just fantastic, too.** Keep in mind that the show wasn't a show yet; there was no indication of whether it'd be popular at all or, if so, among whom, so they put together a *remarkably* diverse cast here of people from all kinds of backgrounds who are all entertaining and interesting for a number of reasons - and then **they give each one a complete story.** There are none - none! - of the underedited ""purple"" characters you get in some later seasons, and nothing close to them. Every single person is built up, and you'll remember every single one when they go out, and none of them are given one-note ""villain"" edits that make them annoying.

I chose to include the ""Watch every season in order! And if you aren't watching every season, you should still watch in order!"" stuff here because I guess season one is the best place to put it, as opposed to a new top-level comment, and it's something I feel super strongly about and wanted to express. But I know that some people still might not be interested in that for whatever reason and want to just go with the ""highlights"" or ""best seasons"", so in my other comments I will explain what I think are the strong points of each season and why you should watch them, and which ones I think are the biggest ""must-watch"" seasons even if you aren't going to watch all of them. **The original ""Survivor"" is a *massive* strong point from the very beginning up through the very end, and absolutely the one must-watch to end all must-watches, even if you're not going to watch any other seasons.** It's just **utterly fantastic** television - there's a reason it managed to score *51.7 million viewers* (!!!) in the span of just a few months. Popularity doesn't always mean good, but in this case, it really freaking was an amazing product that transfixed people for a reason. To even call it a ""season of Survivor"" feels strange, because ""seasons of Survivor"" weren't a thing yet; there was just the one ""Survivor."" It was its own isolated little thing, and then 29 seasons branched off of it.

I think anyone who has any interest in 00s US pop culture or television should watch this, absolutely without question - or anyone who enjoys watching things, because it's just fucking great. So certainly, *certainly* anyone who's interested in the franchise that it eventually launched should absolutely, absolutely watch this brilliant television experience. Seriously, this is just... amazing, the original ""Survivor"" is fucking incredible, and again, even if you don't care about the history or development of the show and aren't going to watch that much of it, there's still 0 reason to not watch this season. **It's so fucking satisfying that I don't even know where to begin. I honestly just find it hard to wrap my mind around the idea of there being Survivor fans who haven't seen this season. Everyone ever should watch it, *especially* fans of this series.**

**Dabu's personal ranking:** 1/27. As of right now, I have it tied for #1 with Marquesas and Pearl Islands, but I'm thinking I'll probably need to either bump them down to #2 (or #1.1 just as a symbolic way of showing respect to them) or put this one up to #0/not rank it at all, because again, to call it a ""season of Survivor"" just feels strange.

**Overall verdict:** If you haven't watched this, you're doing yourself a disservice. Go! Watch it now! Right now! Not tomorrow; *today!*

1.0,Borneo,crlfo0f,"I go back and rewatch Borneo once every few years. Each time I do I see how much greater of a gap there is between it and modern Survivor, but each time I do I appreciate how much the season stands up on its own merits. 

Strategy is almost nonexistent. It also doesn't matter. What you're seeing is the show in its purest form: sixteen Americans with diverse backgrounds being put in the wilderness and competing against each other for a million dollars. What kind of society will they build? What traits will they value more than others? How seriously will they take the competition aspect? How cutthroat will they be?

I need to rewatch Micronesia to know whether I personally like it or not - but I do think I still generally understand its merit as a Survivor season from a more objective standpoint. It's a fun, exciting, more ostensibly ""strategic"" season and, for better or for worse, a gateway into some of the more modern seasons, and it's often considered to be especially exciting the first time that you watch it - but this comes somewhat at the expense of complex storytelling, with not much going on besides the surprise factor. I've seen it compared to ""Survivor candy"": It's yummy and easy to like but doesn't really leave you with anything.

I'm not sure how I feel on it or how much I agree with those criticisms because I need to rewatch it - but I **definitely** think that this should not be where you start, or close to it. It misrepresents the franchise and is an anomaly in how excitement-oriented it is, even compared to many of the seasons that came after it. And, of course, half of the cast are returning players whom you should watch in their original seasons first.

9.0,Vanuatu,crmh1xe,"This to me is a top 3 season. I put it right up there with Pearl Islands and Borneo.

I'll come right out and say the obvious, the end is amazing. It's just so good. It so fun and unpredictable and heart wrenching and just everything good about survivor is present. If there was ever a season that could deliver on the level of the Vanuatu finale every episode, it'd probably be the best season of any show ever.

A lot of people say it has a shaky start. Honestly, I don''t think so. I really dig the premiere, and I really, really did the second episode as well. From there, sure, it's not the greatest, but it's not bad either, and that only lasts a few episodes.

The best thing about this season is the boot order. Only Borneo can rival it in terms of just blatantly having every fantastic character all in the end. There are one or two pre-jury people I'd trade one or two late gamers for, but generally I adore the late game cast, more and more for every second they are on screen.

It has the best finalists ever, in the best FTC ever, in my opinion. I totally agree with /u/vacalicious in it being the best scene of survivor (as my favourite moment, from Pearl Islands, crosses into multiple scenes). My second favourite survivor of all time is present in this season, as it my 6th favourite, both of whom are surrounded by a handful of top 100 survivors who I similarly adore.

Of course I recommend it. It's a fairly well loved season, but I think of it as underrated.

It has some really colorful characters, it has some moments that are *super* unpredictable and satisfying, it has some incredibly complex characters. It has great moral struggles, it has great strategy, it has a bitchin' location complete with volcanoes. It has a great and entertaining winner. It has pretty much everything that you could ever want in a Survivor season. Very, very well-rounded season with a wide enough pool of characters that you'll almost certainly find someone to like. I don't really have a ton to say on it, particularly without spoiling some of its storylines, except that I think it is quite good at everything, I think it is a very strong addition to Survivor canon, and I think it is absolutely a season you should watch.

What I will say is that Vanuatu is best described as a ""slow burn"", and not just because ""burn"" creates a bit of a pun with all the volcanoes. If you start it and you're a few episodes in, and you're thinking ""This is okay, but.. why do people love it so much?"", don't worry. Most people don't love it for the first few episodes (though I do think the premiere is pretty great.) It builds and builds, it gets better as it goes, and everything that eventually happens is very much worth the setup. So when you watch Vanuatu, have faith and know that even if you aren't zomgcrazy about the beginning, that doesn't mean it won't turn out to be one of your favorites. A very strong season.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 12/27, but upon a rewatch, I expect it to probably jump up to 10 or higher.

**Overall verdict**: Of the 9-16 era, I'd probably put Vanuatu second only to Palau as a ""must-watch"" one. It's a super impressive season that does just about everything right and just about nothing wrong, and while I wouldn't pick it right away for someone to watch, it's definitely one that you should watch at some point and will probably really, really enjoy.

That it didn't go the way that it was supposed to, that it wasn't ""right"". Australia was the inevitable reaction. Obviously there were still alliances, but for the most part everybody played the game diplomatically. You had the same style of editing as Borneo for the most part, but without the great moral dilemmas. People were going to do the ""right"" thing, sometimes at the expense of their own alliance/gameplay.

Probably worth a watch for the iconic moments and because as of next season literally half the cast will have played again, but I was never a big fan of Australia.",5
2.0,"Australian
Outback",crlj76k,One of the best casts the show has had.  One of the best episodes the series has ever produced is in this season (easily top 5 IMO).  One of the seasons with the most interesting things to happen with in the survival part of the game.  There is it's fair share of cut throat strategy but unlike many seasons most of it happens pre-merge and it isn't highlighted by the editing (due to the negative reaction to the strategy during the first season by the public).  But it is there and is very interesting if you're paying attention for it.,6
2.0,"Australian
Outback",crlkuvl,"This is the nicest cast of the show. Even the mean people are really not that bad. One person in the cast is probably the most positive survivor character of all time, who I really enjoy.

There are contextual reasons why I have issues with this season. Of the final three, I believe two of them were portrayed dishonestly, one of which to the point of utter confusion as I attempt to reconcile the gulf between how the people in the season perceived them vs how I had seen them behave.

What I would call the best episode of all of survivor is in this season (though it's strictly speaking only my second favourite episode). Additionally, this season has more returning players than any other with half the cast returning as of season 31. This is among the most solid casts the show has ever had, and a perfect group to showcase for the most watched season of survivor ever.

I should mention the location. Australia is brutal. The environment is essentially a 17th character in this season. You think the contestants have been through enough but it just keeps coming. It's very cool to see, and while people may have had doubts about the legitimacy of the survival aspects during season 1, this season removed all doubt for good reason.

I absolutely recommend it. I do think it has flaws, some episodes have obvious outcomes and were just destined to be boring, and you really have to look hard to see the game hiding behind the edit and facades here, but overall the cast, the environment and just how iconic this season is makes it worth checking out at least.",4
2.0,"Australian
Outback",crm5j9h,I love this season because it just feels epic--it has a stellar cast and was aired at the show's absolute peak viewership and you can just feel how transcendent it is. ,2
2.0,"Australian
Outback",crlmjex,"Half of the Australia cast has returned, as of S31. Now, returning players don't always mean that a season or its cast are great (lookin' @ u cook islands), since sometimes ""meh"" characters are just brought back because producers are friends with them, because they were available when someone else had to drop out last-minute, or in BvW seasons for their relatives... but in the case of Australia, I do think it's a good illustration, and result, of just how major and important this season is. The original ""Survivor"" was a really big deal, but a LOT of people were upset about it being such a big deal for a LOT of reasons and wanted to see it fail, so ""Survivor 2"" had to be a freaking awesome show; if it weren't, people would think the first one was just a lame gimmick, its very large number of very emphatic detractors would be proven right, and it'd get shut down.

We're still here, so obviously, that didn't happen. And we're still here because this season was a pretty freakin' great one. The winner is a major, maaaajor favorite of mine whom I'll rant about at length to anyone who will listen and most who won't, and even aside from the winner, the cast is full of some of the best, most complex, most memorable and beloved characters ever. The nature and survivalism are stronger here than pretty much anywhere else, giving us some incredibly dramatic and compelling scenes that really drive home how much more goes on besides just ""the game."" And on top of all of that, this season contains what I think is hands down, without question the best epsoed in the entire history of Survivor - even if it weren't already great, this whole season would be worth sitting through just for that one alone. This season might not be the most popular among some fans who really love the fast pace of the recent seasons; there's definitely strategy stuff going on, but a lot of it is hidden or more subtle. It isn't a fast-paced, adrenaline one.. but if you're looking for an emotional, character-driven season or a season with focus on nature, Australia is just about impossible to beat. Some people might say that the season gets uninteresting after a certain point in the post-merge, but as Reddit's own Neckman once said: ""The endgame villains are the powers of Nature, Ethics and Fate. The Survivors aren't contending with a villainous player, but they're fighting the wilderness, they're fighting their own ethical dilemmas, and they're fighting the unknown."" It is absolutely, absolutely worth watching.

(Also worth noting: This season, more than any other, kind of *needs* context to really know what's going on at certain points, because it was *very* much a reaction to the first season and how it was perceived... specifically, people at the time did NOT like how the first season went, not even a little. Having seen the first season and knowing that is rather important to understanding some of the themes and editing of this one. If you're considering watching Australia but haven't seen Borneo, I'd say watch Borneo first. [Of course, I'd also say everyone ever should watch Borneo cuz it's fuckin' awesome.])

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 5/27

**Overall verdict:** Might not be everyone's cup of tea but definitely something that everyone should watch. A brilliant follow-up to the original Survivor, as it needed to be, whose story may be unorthodox at some points but is brilliant throughout. It's funny, it's shocking, it's dramatic, it's harrowing, and you are missing out on a lot of the best and most iconic Survivor content if you still haven't seen this one.

#edit: Also, like /u/WhiteChocolate12 said for HvV, I probably wouldn't watch the Next Time On segments for this season.

...or, honestly, any season. There is 0 reason to watch those when you can just queue up the next episode anyway. All they can really do is spoil you. Pretty much the only reason I even watch them live is because I know other people will be discussing them anyway.

edit edit: What I'll also add is that this season and some of its latter stages, though heavily enjoyable to me, are probably slower than the seasons that surround it - so if you watch this one and don't really dig it, that doesn't at all mean you won't enjoy 3 or *especially* 1 and *especcccially* 4.",1

3.0,Africa,crlh5mn,"This season introduced us to the original dysfunctional tribe. Casaya, Fang, and Luzon owe it a debt. The cast was very strong. There was no shortage of heroes, villains, sweethearts, strategists, and underdogs. Like all the early seasons, strategy wasn't a main focus of the edit, but that doesn't mean it was nonexistent. The show did a good job of showing the relationships that had developed between the castaways, and those relationships impacted the game in interesting ways.

*Africa* also shows you just how great the aesthetics of the show were back when it wasn't on a generic island every season. The cinematography is breathtaking, and the conditions in Kenya were truly brutal. In an era where we just repeat locations over and over, it's great to see *Survivor* played in a location that's truly unique.

I do feel that *Africa* is a truly underrated season, and I wish more people remembered it. I think T-Bird would definitely be on *Cambodia* right now if it was a more recent season.",15

Combine that with the location and it's an easy top 10, borderline top 5 season for me. The second best season in the first 5 aside from Borneo, watch watch watch!",4
3.0,Africa,crlhp5x,"Not the most strategically gripping season, but the unique and BRUTAL location plus the fantastic cast make Africa really underrated in my opinion. I think if you watch it looking more for the social and survival game than the strategy game, it's extremely enjoyable.",4
3.0,Africa,crlmlc8,"It's often said that in the earliest seasons of Survivor, the location itself was the ""17th player"" or ""17th character."" Nowhere - *nowhere* - is this truer than season three. Kenya is utterly without question my pick for the best location ever. It's so starkly different from anywhere else they've ever gone that every single second of this season just *feels* so different than any other one - and it's a positive difference, because it's so fucking stunning and gorgeous. They're actually out there in the middle of the savanna, which is astounding. It really drives home, with every single shot, that these are 16 Americans just dropped off into some other pocket of the world they'd probably never, ever see otherwise, and it's astounding. This comes into play in some of the challenges and rewards in ways that are nothing short of beautiful. If anything can make you appreciate the environmental, *survival* side of Survivor (besides Australia's aptly titled ""No Longer Just A Game"" episode), it's the entirety of this season.

Aside from all of that, you have some incredible and colorful characters here; this is probably in my top 5 or so favorite Survivor casts. There are plenty of contestants you'll love, love to hate, laugh at, and laugh with. Comic relief, heroes, villains, this season's got it all. It has a couple of the most iconic pre-merge boots ever, it has one of the most respected winners ever, and tons of characters in between are among the most popular, most unique, and most entertaining the show has ever seen.

And, oh yeah, it has one of the most shocking and unprecedented Survivor moments ever a few episodes in (which, of course, does benefit massively from having seen seasons one and two.)

Above all else, it's just an entertaining viewing experience. I just love this season in a way that's hard for me to really put into words, which isn't really a problem I often have. I think it's just that I utterly adore the location and generally love the cast - I dunno, I just feel excellent watching it. You've got awesome contestants here saying and doing awesome things in an awesome setting, making for an awesome product that I'm very happy is a part of Survivor canon and highly recommend to any and every Survivor fan.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 4/27

**Overall verdict**: This is a really fun, feel-good collection of episodes that'll leave you really satisfied. I really don't think there's much to complain about here, if anything. It's just good times. If you spend your time watching it, you certainly will not regret it, and you'll almost definitely come out of it with a few new favorite contestants.

It feels good to watch. It's fun and fascinating but a little ugly early on, and while it has drama all the way throughout the season, generally speaking you find yourself endeared to the cast and really rooting for everyones success.

The progression here is from wildly entertaining to pleasantly satisfying. In my mind, that's a step down, but it's not a step down into anything bad. Relatively speaking, Africa is not so important, compared to all the seasons surrounding it, but it's just enjoyable. If someone legitimately told me they loathed Africa, not going to lie, I'd think something was wrong with them. I gives something for the strategy fans, something for the social experiment fans, and plenty for the people who just enjoy watching those that they like. And it's pretty funny at times too!

Do I recommend it? Oh yeah, easily. It'll hook you quickly, and it'll throw enough your way to maintain interest all the way to the fun ending.

Great cast? ""Yeah they're pretty good""

Great location/theme? ""Yeah it's quite cool""

Great story? ""Yeah it's not bad""

Guatemala has something to like at every point of the season. But to be honest, it has nothing you've never seen before. Every aspect of Guatemala is done elsewhere, and generally, done better.

I don't want to be too down on it. It's great. A lot of dull people are out early, and you wind up with a uniformly solidly memorable remaining cast pretty darn early in the season. It has some cool moments, but frankly, it's very irrelevant to survivor as a whole.

The cruel joke about Guatemala is that I think it'd be a great early season on its own merit. However it features returning players from the vastly superior Palau, a season so unique that it demands you get a decent amount of seasons under your belt first so you can appreciate it for how unique it is. Guatemala will spoil Palau like fucking crazy, so don't even think about watching it first, but it's a real shame that something so suited to being an early pick is shackled by a late pick pre-requisite like Palau

Do I recommend it? Yeah. Go in order or just go through the highlights, eventually seasons are going to stop jumping out at you. You've seen Palau by this point, and you're looking for something just to enjoy. This is a safe bet. Some comedy, good strategy, and a few sweet moments as well. I'd be baffled if you hated it, but I really don't think many people are going to totally revere it either.

Even though it has returning players, they aren't the nucleus of the entire season and the editing is extremely well-balanced. If you haven't seen it yet, it's a top priority. **Top 10 Baby!**",6
11.0,Guatemala,crlmtkt,"(**RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!!:** Guatemala contains returning players from season 10. Do not watch it until you have seen season 10.)

Guatemala is sort of the forgotten ""black sheep"" of Survivor seasons. It is unique in that, other than one recent season, it is the only season in Survivor history that introduced no players who would later return - primarily because production just kind of hated filming it due to an awful location and some contestants who were super hard to work with off-camera - which of course deters newer fans from going back and checking it out, and it doesn't stand out too strongly in any one particular area, so it just isn't talked about much. It's mostly just talked about for being the season nobody ever talks about.

This might make you think ""Well, it's probably boring, so I'll skip it!"" - but you shouldn't. Guatemala has one of the best locations of any Survivor season. One tribe's camp is located in an *actual Mayan ruin!!*, which is just so fucking cool! It has some pretty emotional and evocative moments, it has some contestants who remain popular to this day for being funny or just plain likable, it has a decently crafted long-term storyline, it introduces some twists that would become fixtures of later seasons. Do I think that it's a season I'd instantly recommend to someone? Probably not. But it's a fine season once you reach it in chronological order and not one you should pass over - or, if you're not watching in order, a decent season that's definitely worth checking out at some point. It has some problems (personally, I dislike parts of the boot order and parts of the editing; I think these are most other people's problems as well), but it has a pretty solid cast of characters and a great location that'll leave you feeling like a more complete, educated, entertained Survivor fan for having seen it, even if it won't be in your all-time top 3 or anything.

(And, hell, maybe it will be in your top 3. I know a fucking DIEHARD Guatemala fan who insists that it's the best of the best of the best of the best. She fucking lives, breathes, bleeds, salivates Guatemala. So, again, you really never know until you actually watch the seasons, which is why it may just be best to go in order and see for yourself what ones you like.)

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 14/27... right in the middle, lol.

**Overall verdict**: That this is considered ""decent Survivor"" just speaks to how strong Survivor is as a show, because this is actually some pretty fucking stellar television. It's just that Survivor is often pretty fucking stellar television, often even more than this, so that and the lack of returning players have caused Guatemala to slide through the cracks over the years.

In addition, the third episode's boot was fairly surprising at the time it aired, although from a modern perspective it's probably a no-brainer.

>S4 IS SO SO SO SO GOOD. omg. Let me try to put it as best as I can without directly spoiling.

>It's like... I feel, honestly, like it is just about everything that any Survivor season ever could or should hope to be. Its narrative is probably the most complex, complete, and fulfilling of any season's ever, other than maybe the first one. It's so well-told, so rich and deep, and every contestant, by the time they're out, really does have their path explored in a unique, interesting way, and that path ties necessarily into the paths of all the *other* contestants; it's a brilliant network of complex, interweaving narratives. And that isn't to say that every single contestant gets a major or visible edit, but almost all of them do, and even the ones who don't do have storylines of their own.

>And those storylines are all pretty fucking excellent, and they culminate in major climaxes - climaxes that are all the more rewarding for how well they were set up.

If you watch the first three back to back, and recognize that at that point those weren't just ""the first three Survivor seasons"" and these old, historical beginnings of a franchise that would span for a decade and a half, but were rather *all the Survivor that had ever existed, ever - the only ways in which any season had ever played out -* and *then* you watch Marquesas, it's just *so* satisfying. That season basically is the season that absolutely everybody had wanted since episode seven of Borneo.

>There are so many big, shocking moments that are unlike anything that came before them and that also set the stage for future seasons; one in particular is just perfection and my favorite moment ever in Survivor, but seriously, there's a wealth of them. (And again, the story is told so well that these are great even outside of their historical merit. They're also excellent climaxes for these characters themselves.) And in between all that there are a TON of fun, memorable, quirky minor moments and scenes that keep it pretty consistently entertaining.
>
>It also has what I consider the best and craziest endgame in Survivor history. The last two episodes are just nuuuuuts, they're compelling and exciting and shocking all at once, with what might be my all-time favorite Survivor finale capping it off. So much freaking stuff happens in that endgame and there are so many twists. And with the ultimate outcome being what it is, I think Marq improves even more on a rewatch.
>
>It's just a beautiful, brilliant, complex season that serves as pretty much the apex of Survivor storytelling, it completely revolutionizes the game and the show, it has tons of colorful characters, it has tons of shocking moments. All around it is just a magnificent magnificent season. I've got a poll open right now to see which seasons /r/survivor has seen, and as of right now Marq is very close to the bottom with a pretty low % of people having seen it. And I think that's just so unfortunate because it's SUCH an important season and SUCH a brilliant viewing experience - especially, again, when placed into its proper and actual context after seasons 1-3. But also on its own.

Seriously, Marquesas is just wowzers. It's a hell of a story. Absolutely, definitely, 50000% worth watching.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 1/27

**Overall verdict**: Marquesas is like a too-good-to-be-true fanfiction. If you had, in 2001 after ""Survivor: Africa"", told someone how Marquesas would go - let alone how expertly they'd put together the events into a television story - they'd have said.. what? no, fuck you, that's not possible, stop getting my hopes up. But it *happened,* and it happened wonderfully. A brilliant and heavily rewarding season even from a modern perspective, and an utterly perfect game-changer after seasons 1-3, Marquesas is juuust under Borneo in terms of what I consider the absolute freaking MUST-watch seasons.

4.0,Marquesas,crlt0s6,"I'm going to provide an alternate opinion to /u/DabuSurvivor.

This season has amazing EPISODES and MOMENTS, and when you look back at it, you'll think it was a strong season. It's entertaining and dramatic, more so than most seasons. It talks about real issues in a frank way few seasons do. It also contributed a lot to survivor metagame, and has a great cast.

But there are a LOT of dry spells in the middle of the pools. I would argue the premerge just switches off between which tribe is dull, and the F8-F6 episodes are some of the most dull episodes in the show's history. The explosive early merge and endgame make up for that though. Overall, a strong season, but don't assume just because it has it's worshipers that you'll worship it as well.",3
4.0,Marquesas,crmgjs4,"OK here's the trouble. Marquesas has a lot of very strong points to it. However, these points are, very rooted in context.

I know Dabu made his case for watching the seasons in order at Borneo, but honestly, Marquesas is the big reason why you want to do the order in my opinion. By modern standards, a lot of the events within are just not that big a deal. A lot of the motivations of the players are hard to comprehend. When you're used to modern survivor, Marquesas suffers, because it has this awesome quality to it where it's the paragon of old school survivor, while simultaneously being the season to kick old school survivor in the ass and tell it to get its head in the game.

Marquesas has some kickass tribals. Some kickass moments. And a seriously solid cast. However, a lot of it is just philosophical for someone who has seen beyond. Some moments are epic here because they had *never* happened before.

Full disclosure. I hated Marquesas when I first watched it. I thought it was fun, but a little frustrating, and then eventually, ugly, with a lacklustre conclusion. On reflection, the frustration is gone, the ugliness, while still present, is a source of a lot of depth and intrigue, and I've come to appreciate how the season shakes out for the sheer wow factor of the fact that it actually happened.

The big thing to consider is this: Marquesas is only season 4. All three seasons that precede it are very highly rated, and there are not many of them. There is really no reason why you can't just watch them before this. If you're already tainted by seeing behind the curtain of new survivor, then my advice it to keep a critical mind when you watch this season. Handful of bland characters and pair of bland episodes aside, nearly everything within this season has a lot of hidden depth to it, and certainly if you need a season to write a report on, this is going to have to be it.

Do I recommend it? Yes, of course. It's an incredibly important season for the franchise, it has an amazing cast and some truly great moments. Would I be surprised if people watched it and didn't get the praise? No. I sure didn't. Context is key, and make sure you appreciate it for the social experiment that it is. Don't let the ugliness get to you, because if you play the role of a passive observer, you'll find that the bad moments are often the most fascinating.",2

They're also total underdogs to where one episode is named ""The Underdogs"" after them, and their challenge streak - and final challenge loss - is one of the most epic, powerful, and emotional in Survivor, like the ""ROB WASN'T HERE!!"" one.

Water",crljbyv,"It's fine. I hate the Blood vs Water twist. Hate it. I think most of what it brings to the table is incredibly forced and both BvW seasons have the same problem where people separate themselves from the game so much, to the point where they congratulate each other for ""sweet moves"" (AKA voting out their friends) and at that point I feel like I might as well go watch an ORG.

Blood vs Water obviously has a big emotional element to it, and I generally like that stuff. But here, it feels like I'm watching Derek (I hope someone has seen that show). It's the reality show equivalent of terrible heavy handed writing, and the show seems to think it's a bigger emotional event that it is, where Jeff unironically asks almost everyone on the way out to describe ways in which their emotional lives and relationships have been altered together as a result of Survivor, and I'm just wishing he'd let people feel or not feel whatever emotions they want without all this blatant coaching.

People like Redemption Island in this season. I think it's fine. I'm still opposed to it as a twist in general though.

Overall, yes, watch it. The pre-merge is decent, and there are some good moments and characters. Just try to ignore Jeff. Never has there been a twist shoved further down your throat than the Blood vs Water twist, and hopefully, there never will be anything to rival that.

I usually hate the loved ones episode and when I saw the theme and then saw the cast I was horrified. BUT, it ends up being a really amazing season in my eyes, where the focus is actually on the loved ones and not the survivor alumni. It's got the Fans vs. Favorites vibe for me, questionable past survivors picked, and then a group of fans, but this season the fans are the best part! Almost every Fan (loved one) is very memorable in my eyes and they added a twist to a twist that made a horrible twist better (but I still hated it).

Just got through (re)watching this one - I watched only about half of it live, and what I watched I watched super casually - and I honestly don't think I was missing virtually anything. So I definitely don't recommend it. It's not particularly *bad,* but it is very predictable, it is often very frustrating, it is often rather dull, and it contains the RI twist yet again. I think it, along with One World is the definition of mediocre Survivor, despite one Tribal Council that I really like and a pre-FTC boot whom I adore. There's already no real reason to dive right into this one - and since half the cast are returning players, and the initial twist/tribal division is very unorthodox, there's a lot of reason not to. Worth watching at some point, but not too early in your Survivor-viewing career. It wastes a lot of time on pointless, artificial ""suspense"" that leads to a really inaccurate and frustrating story.

Blood versus Water also works better with returning players in my opinion, because it adds one more element to the game: deservingness. Will a returning player switch places with their loved one in order to let them experience the game? In addition, the Redemption Island gives more weight to the family connections twist: it makes the bonds actually matter.

The returning players are an odd bunch, they vary in success, recency, and strategy, but they are all (for the most part) worthy choices. For once, the newbie tribe is chock full of characters, many of whom are up to return in S31.

29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",crlr28k,"I really, really, really like SJDS. I think it is one of the most well-rounded seasons. First off, I think that it's a largely character-driven narrative with a very balanced edit, so you're given a reason to care about pretty much everyone in the cast - a cast that I think is comprised of very likable and entertaining personalities. And these likable, entertaining people also happen to be maybe the smartest and most strategically proactive cast we've had in *years* - giving it some majorly shocking strategic moments and twists and impressive moves... made by, and involving, contestants who have been set up as more than just tepid gamebots but actual people you'll get invested in. So basically, it's entertaining people whose stories are told in a complex and interesting way and who then play freaking stellar and incredibly dynamic games... it succeeds on absolutely all fronts. I can't think of anything this season doesn't do right. And it has one of my favorite sets of endgamers in all of Survivor history. I really enjoyed almost every single member of the cast, and the ones I enjoyed the most all made it pretty far. I absolutely loved the winner, and two other contestants from this one probably rank in my all-time top 25, which is like unheard of for a modern season.

Some people think the pre-merge was slow, but I was more hyped after the premiere than I have been for any season maybe in my entire time watching, and I think that it really never lost steam after that; episode 2 was kinda ehh and had me worried, but it sets up some later events quite nicely and is a better episode in retrospect for moving the season along. Episode 6, too, is a little ehh but also a necessary evil for the boot order. Outside of that, I really, really enjoyed every single week - so when the worst thing I can say about a season is ""There were two episodes that aren't totally exciting on their own but still make the season better, and I actively enjoyed every other week""... fuck, that's probably a good season. 

I don't know, I just don't get why its reception was so lukewarm for some folks. I loved it. I thought it was a well-rounded season with excellent storytelling and characters - one that set up its story well, making its twists and turns even more fun. I thought it was very fun and satisfying pretty much every single week, and I definitely think it's worth watching and pretty much the high point of post-HvV Survivor. Excellent characters playing excellent and exciting games.

Now, I wouldn't *start* with it, because it comes along so late in the show's run and the BvW twist (which I thought was handled much better here than in S27) makes it different from most other seasons. But I think it might go down in Survivor history as a kind of ""meh"" season, deterring future people from watching it, which really sucks and I'd really like to be a voice of strong pro-S29 support and say that this one does pretty much everything right and should definitely be watched with a fair shot and open mind.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 9/27

**Overall verdict:** Don't watch it first, but if you haven't seen it (which most people on this sub probably have), you should totally check it out at some point.

Hell, one of the most satisfying ever, and *the* most satisfying in years.",11
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",crlkhwo,"I like this season a lot less than most. There are two main reasons why:

First, the BvW twist. It was heavyhanded in the first iteration, but here it's on a new level. You get people acting like their loved ones are on death row whenever something bad happens. You have emotional moments pulled like teeth from contrived situations, even by reality show standards, and you have the addition of loved ones almost making for an astonishingly boring endgame.

My bigger gripe is the attitude of the season. Basically, it's total propaganda. Every second player spends half their confessionals talking about how ""You need to make big moves to win the game"" ""You can't win without making big moves"" ""I need to do this because it would be a big move"". It's bullshit. Samoa established some totally wrong ideas about what Survivor is and it got embedded deep within the fanbase. After spending years cleansing itself we get hit with this season which not only brings the concept of defined jury criteria back, but also seems to for the most part successfully integrate into the attitudes of the players themselves!

The pre-merge is poor, save for one great episode, and (spoiler tagged to be sure, even though it's quite vague) [the merge episode was one of the worst the show has ever had.](/spoiler) Post-merge, my first gripe essentially goes away, but my second one does nothing but get stronger and stronger.

I like a lot of the cast. Even the people I have huge problems with I like for the most part. The finale, as well as one pre-merge and one post merge episode are all great and can stand up to the better episodes of most seasons, but this one really hit a nerve for me. It feels like the embodiment of everything I hope survivor doesn't become and worst of all, this season is a big favourite of hardcore fans who are generally the ones I can count on the be against the reduction of survivor to a basic game like this season attempts to.

Do I recommend it? Sure. I will say that if you hate it early on, just wait. If you think it's heading towards a poor ending, just wait. This season plays well to those who have faith. And while my lack of faith in the season was proven wrong by the end of it, the result of my lack of faith in the future of survivor beyond this season still remains to be seen.",18

The incorporation of family members puts a lot of clueless, uncycnical players into the mix that often think with their hearts and make good TV in the process.

As its ranking can attest though, it's obviously not for everyone. There's some riveting strategy in the endgame, but players who watch purely for strategy will have mentally checked out long before that. Character-study fans on the other hand will be in hog heaven.

Perhaps that's because of the greatest difference between SJDS and the original: a familiarity with half the cast.  I may be in the minority here, but I feel that the theme was less successful this season, given the fact that in its first iteration, we knew half of the crew's emotional makeup.  

Rupert, for example, was set to be a force that season, but he had a glaring Achilles heel in his wife and every returning player knew it.  One quick vote and it was essentially over.  It was jarring and put everyone on alert: this is not the Survivor you're used to.  

Similarly, Laura M telling Ciera to vote out her own mother was particularly jarring, given that Laura M was a ferocious competitor, their bond was very strong, but it was the best play to keep Ciera going deep into the game.

Not only was everyone used to the BvW twist by SJDS, but the big moves didn't happen until the end (without Natalie, this would have gone down as one of my bottom five seasons) and, again, I simply didn't like their attempt to generate extra drama by the loved ones playing each other for reward.

With S27 I feel like there's typically a sense that the returning players are going to be central to the narrative of their pair which I don't really care for.

I don't really watch Survivor for ""big moves"", but even so, I'm not sure why you think it was lacking in them? Episode one had Baylor playing both sides and betraying an alliance, which caused some arguing in episode two, where Val made a move to save herself with the Idol lie until Josh made a last-minute move to switch his vote and take her out. Then John was blindsided in a big blindside that changed the dynamics of the tribe, then Drew was blindsided. Kelley/Dale votes were straightforward, but then we have the Josh vote, then the Jeremy blindside, then the plan to take Jon out foiled by ""STICK TO THE PLAN :|""..

Despite all the betrayals there are, the motivations of the flippers are well depicted and the lack of bait and switch editing makes them feel very logical even when they actually are blindsides to the players.

13.0,Cook Islands,crln7i0,"Cook Islands is often a kind of polarizing season. Personally, I really, really, *reaaally* hate it. I think it's incredibly dull, I think its only ostensibly and potentially notable storylines are the direct result of lame twists and have their effects diminished by the minor edits or dull personalities of the contestants they involved, I think it's *easily* the worst cast in Survivor history (maybe bested by S26) despite a few stars.. When people just say ""CI is boring"", I think that's giving it too much credit, because it's also a convoluted mess of pointless twists - one of which the F3, stuck around and became a fixture of the franchise. Eeek.

But, that said!: A lot of people do really enjoy it, so it can't hurt to check it out, because maybe you'll be one of them. Consensus is often that it's good the first time around, then sucks on the rewatch (though I didn't care for it the first time, either, after the first couple episodes.) However, even outside of my typical ""watch in order!"" recommendation, I really wouldn't recommend this one as an early season. Even if you like some of its storylines, its *massive* amount of underedited contestants and bafflingly large array of twists leave this a very ""un-Survivor-y"" season that I don't think accurately represents what's often great about the franchise.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 25/27

**Overall verdict:** I think it's super dull and much of the time actively awful with its twists and editing. It does have some fans, though, so you might enjoy it - but even though it has some players whom production liked enough to bring back later on, I don't think it should be one of the first few seasons you watch by any means.

Also worth noting is that while 4 contestants from this season have returned, it also has one of the biggest casts, with 20 people. (Proportionally that's about the same as 3 contestants returning from a 16-player season, like Africa.)",4

Sure, it has a bad twist in it. But the twist doesn't even matter really so whatever. Sure, a few people go home in ways that may disappoint you. Sure, things may not play out how you expect or initially want.

But to that I say who cares? Roll with it, love it. Nicaragua is on paper a very ordinary season, but the freaky cast, the weird dynamics, and the cool unpredictable yet balanced storytelling really serve up something special here. You might not like how a lot of people leave the season but you sure as hell appreciate them while they're there.

I know Nicaragua is going to be low with some mixed reviews, so I think it's a safe bet anybody following this thread will have a few seasons under their belt before checking this one out. Ask yourself this: Did I like Panama? Did I like Gabon?

If the answer is yes, then congratulations, I think we've found your season. Funny, crazy and unique, Nicaragua absolutely blows the competition away for where it's ranked here. If you leave it till later like I did, and watch it with the genuinely bad seasons, you're going to find yourself baffled as to what the heck everyones problem with it was.

Do I recommend it? Yes I do! Doesn't especially matter where in the timeline, it's not a very important season, but it's definitely a fun one, and it's always fun to love a cult classic, and this is probably the most cult classic-esque season of Survivor there is, aside from maybe Marquesas.",13

In a fucking excellent way, though. I just do not understand this season's negative reception, at all. I guess if you're looking for great, visible ""strategists"" it might not be the best, though even there I think it's sort of underrated. But regardless of that, this season has an absolutely brilliant cast of lovable, love to hate-able, hilarious, colorful contestants. It's such a fun fucking ride.

Don't watch it first or particularly early because it does have some kind of funky stuff going on.

Worlds apart is a season that kicks you over and over and over again, and you are always waiting for it to stop, and it always goes for longer than you'd expect. And when it finally does, the relief you were looking forward to is totally eclipsed by the residual pain of having been kicked so many times.

Does that analogy make sense? Dunno. But it sure as hell reflects how I felt through this season. It's a shame too because the cast has quite a lot of potential, but unfortunate events and unfortunate edits strip a lot of that away.

You have to be ready to laugh at some bad things if you're going to make it through this. Because bad things are going to happen, and you're not exactly spoiled for choice in ways that you can deal with them. Be amused or be appalled, I didn't see an especially large amount of middle ground here.

If you don't know much on edit analysis, then that'll help you here. Knowing about how the edit works is a great way to make this season worse. That is just about the only reason I can think of to watch this one early.

Should you watch it? It comes late and it's not too great. There are at least 20 seasons you'd be better off watching, but if you do make it to the bottom of the barrel, this one might be just a tiny bit refreshing by comparison. It isn't totally horrible.

Even besides that, I think the season was just sort of dull. There are, like, two episodes that I really enjoyed. Contrast that with SJDS where there are only two episodes I *didn't* really enjoy, and you have a season that makes me pretty worried about whether 28/29 are really an upswing or just the last bastion of good Survivor in a sea of mediocrity.

It has some okay stuff and some likable early boots or jurors, but I would really never recommend this season to anyone ever unless they're watching all of them and have already seen, like, 23 of 30 - there's just nothing strong to take away from it. It's not even just about the ugliness, which some people might enjoy because they find it funny or whatever; I think it's just a dreary ""meh"" most of the time.

This season has a fairly decent cast... I think. I wouldn't *actually* know because half of them are barely in the season.

It's not a season to make you feel good. But it has plenty of merit. There is a modest collection of genuinely funny people, and people to root for as well. And the central character is an incredibly divisive character that it wouldn't be right for me to brush over. In this season, I am not a fan of them, because of the ridiculous oversaturation we get, but some people are absolute fanatics over them, so see for yourself. But if you don't like that person, then fair warning, the cast is going to tank as a whole for you, because pretty much nobody else gets the chance to be a big favourite like you'd probably have from other, better seasons.

Overall, I think watch it if you have any intention of talking about survivor online afterwards, and, I guess *maybe* watch it if you don't.

Don't start with this season. Don't put this season anywhere near your starting point. It's just about the biggest misrepresentation of the franchise that I can possibly imagine. No other season has an edit or narrative like this one, and that is not an endorsement of it.

I think it has a great cast on paper, I think in theory it could have been a top, like, 6 season of all time, but none of that matters. What you'll watch here is the edited product, and the edited product is so fucking frustrating, so weird, and SUCH a misrepresentation of everything about Survivor that it should not be anywhere near the first one you watch.

Some people do like it in spite of its edit, so maybe it'll end up in your top 6 or higher, but I cannot stress enough how much this season is an anomaly that should not be anywhere close to the first season you watch.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 24/27

Having that whole tribe get so downplayed was such a shame, because there were so many good narrators and weird little storylines that didn't get nearly enough airtime (if they got featured at all).

That said, it has a few really great moments. Really really great moments honestly, right up there with the best of almost all the seasons. I would also say that for the actual game of survivor, Fiji was something of a turning point in a few ways.

I would rank Fiji low, but it's not irredeemable. I'm not going to recommend it, but I wouldn't advise against it either. You just don't know until you try.

You have white douchebags, black douchebags, latino douchebags, even an asian douchebag, proving that douchebaggery crosses all racial lines.

14.0,Fiji,crlnemk,"Fiji is a polarizing season. Lots of people hate it, some vocal people love it, I'd say its overall reception is neutral bordering on negative. Personally, I'm pretty much in that boat, too. Whenever you do watch it, you'll take some good stuff out of it: the winner is fantastic, one or two of the characters are probably among Survivor's best, and there are some super fun and complex moments along the way.

But... those moments and characters are few and far between. A lot of the episodes are just ""blah"" and uninspiring, and massive amounts of the cast are underedited nothings whom you'll have no reason to care about; among those who aren't, most are unlikable ones you probably won't enjoy, leaving this season a kind of ugly one. I don't dislike it - I'm ambivalent towards it - but I rank it lowest out of all the seasons I don't dislike, and it definitely has some really strong flaws that I think mean there's really no reason to recommend it. If you're watching in order, watch it when you get to it; otherwise, I think that there is probably little to no reason to put this one particularly high on your to-do list. Location is freaking stunning, though.

(But again, of course, that's just one person's opinion. Some people utterly adore Fiji, and you might be one of them. So it's certainly not something you should skip.)

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 21/27

I do agree this cast reminds me a lot of Cook Islands, a bunch of people who aren't playing but just floating around and are kinda boring. But there are some characters that are great too.

8.0,All-Stars,crlevei,"Survivor’s “darkest” season. All-Stars is like a Greek Tragedy, Shakespeare play, or ASOIAF novel, in which ½ the cast has died terribly by the final curtain, while those who lived are worse off for their experience. S8 is defined by painfully awkward moments, harsh fates befalling fan favorites, and bitterness and backstabbing among friends. I can understand its unpopularity.

However, I’ve always appreciated All-Stars as an “alternative” to Survivor’s typical cheerier, happier seasons. The brutal boot-order, smirking villains, vicious betrayals, ruined friendships— I loved it all. I need maximum variety in my life, and All-Stars is definitely an outlier across the Survivor spectrum. But this extra dark season is certainly not everyone’s cup of tea.",30
8.0,All-Stars,crlft51,"Piggybacking off the reply that /u/vacalicious made, this is where Survivor truly started to transition into its modern mode. The personal relationships that the players had built over the course of the first seven seasons? Shattered, all in the name of progressing further in the game. 

All-Stars is a season where an all-time player (who has played across multiple seasons and eras) truly established him or herself in the pantheon. If you're a fan of bitter FTC juries, this season probably tops them all - and pretty much every juror had a solid reason for the bitterness. 

If you don't like stories where your heroes fall, probably worth a skip.",9
8.0,All-Stars,crli7cc,"This was my least favourite season before I started Redemption Island. There are plenty of seasons I like more than this one that have less good moments in it, but their bad moments don't even come close to the ones present here.

Basically, everyone has an ego here. People aren't there to have an adventure or have fun. I wouldn't even say that they are there to play honestly. They're there to win. So when the vast majority of them *don't* win, you see that spirit turn ugly.

There is an overarching plot to the season that I hate and I think is fake as hell. A lot of people like it a lot though and it's pretty commonly believed to be totally genuine so maybe I'm the weird one here.

The biggest thing about this season is that something just... shit happens during it. What I would call the worst moment and worst episode of survivor history are in this season and for me, it drags it way the fuck down. Combine that with a fairly uneventful late game and you get a season that I really had to push myself to finish.

Unfortunately, it has a lot of implications for survivor in general, so for big fans you do kind of have to watch it eventually. But if that's not of interest to you and you're just looking to be entertained then I'd say stay away. The good moments are quite good, but not at all worth the tradeoff here.

8.0,All-Stars,crlglc3,Includes returning players from each of the first 7 seasons.,2
8.0,All-Stars,crlmq47,"(**RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!!:** All-Stars contains players from seasons 1-7. You should really avoid watching this one until you have seen its players on their original seasons!)

All-Stars is... wow. Not... uh. Not a good one, in my book, I can't say. Not a good one in many people's books. Pretty much everyone agrees that most of the first five episodes are fun, but past that, there's a loooot of things that don't go too well here. It'd be a spoiler to really explain further.

...Buuuut guess what? Not everyone agrees with me. Some people enjoy it as kind of a dark Greek tragedy, those are the words I see pro-S8 people often using. I don't agree with them, really - but maybe you will. Their opinion is just as A-OK as mine and I can't say otherwise. So who knows? Maybe you'll like All-Stars, if you kind of know going in that it's.. not going to go exactly how you might expect or want it to, and it's definitely *not* the fun celebration of Survivor it was intended to be. If you don't expect something like that, you might enjoy it. I still think it's pretty miserable, though.

And, honestly, even aside from the dark stuff, I think this season just gets kind of boring. Like, it isn't even consistently ""Omg! Big polarizing emotional dark moment!"" It's that at some points, but then at a lot of other points, it's just ""..oh. Well this is a dull and pointless episode.""

If nothing else, I feel like this is one you kind of need to watch if you're going through the franchise (again, only after seeing the first 7, please for the love of god don't watch this one before seasons 1-4 in particular.) There's a contestant who wasn't *totally* significant in their first season, turned out to be super significant here, then got brought back for HvV and another season past that. If you skip this one, that contestant playing in four seasons will probably be a little weird. So I guess you sorta have to bite the bullet on this one - and who knows, maybe you'll find a way to enjoy it; some people have. Although this is maybe where you can kind of abandon chronological order, just because this season is sort of a buzzkill and hangover after the wonder of All-Stars, so if you wanted to push this one forward to around 10 or 11 or 12 or something, that might not be the worst idea.

(I will add that all of this stuff - the ""I think it sucks, but hey maybe you won't! So give it a try!"" - applies to *most* of the season.. but there's one exceptionally, almost astoundingly creatively bad episode that I honestly cannot fathom how anyone would possibly enjoy. The thought of someone looking at that episode and thinking ""Yeah, that's fun TV!"" actually kind of sickens me. BUT! For the most part, this is not a favorite of Dabu, it is not a favorite of many people, but maybe you'll like it.)

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: I need to rewatch it to iron out a specific placement, so it's one of the three that I don't have ranked. Somewhere in my bottom five. Don't know precisely where, but probably 3rd or 4th from the bottom.

**Overall verdict**: I think it blows, a fucking lot, but some people like it.

5.0,Thailand,crlmnza,"I think Survivor: Thailand best illustrates how sometimes these threads can be sort of unreliable. It's easily the least-viewed season on this subreddit, and I think it's probably going to end up at or near the bottom of the thread. Many people will say ""A lame season, except for the winner, but the winner doesn't make it worth watching""; on the other hand, I feel very strongly that Thailand is *totally* worth watching - *except* for the winner, whom I really can't stand. And I know that I'm not the only one who feels this way. There are diehard Thailand fans, and who's to say they're wrong? Thailand illustrates why you really should give every season a try. Maybe you'll dislike it, but maybe you won't. Maybe you'll join the cool kids' table of Thailand fans; there are dozens of us!

I don't think Thailand is perfect by any means. It doesn't play out in an exceptionally interesting way, culminating in a win I hate. One or two of the episodes do feel like kinda pointless wastes of time. A fair amount of contestants are underedited - certainly more than in any of the first four seasons. It has its flaws, and it isn't the first season I'd show someone trying to get into the show. But it also has its strengths - strengths that *you are missing out on* if you just shrug your shoulders and say ""Eh, Thailand's supposed to suck, right? I got no reason to watch it."" Thailand has some of my all-time favorite characters, some of the most colorful and memorable. Thailand has one of my picks for the best pairs of back-to-back episodes *ever* in the history of the franchise; excluding finales, I can really only think of a couple of pairs that top it, and pretty much none outside of Marquesas/Pearl Islands. It has a long-term narrative that I think is very satisfying and set up very well. It has some super bold production decisions and twists that are really unlike anything that came before. Production-wise - the props and sets and whatnot - it has maybe my favorite aesthetics of every season.

So no, Thailand isn't perfect. But I feel that it is a lot more fun, daring, and satisfying than it's almost always given credit for being. Maybe you'll disagree with me and think it sucks and is awful, but maybe you won't. Maybe you'll agree with me; maybe you'll even agree with me *and* like the winner, which would render Thailand a pretty excellent, top-tier season. You don't know unless you watch it.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking**: 13/27

**Overall verdict**: Do you absolutely, utterly *neeeeeed* to watch Survivor: Thailand? No, unless you're watching every season in order (which I think you should.) It's the only one of the first 7 seasons I don't think is must-watch material. If you're just going to watch a few seasons, should you pick Thailand? Probably not; there are stronger ones, including all four that precede it. But it isn't even close to the last season I'd tell someone to watch, and it does have some really colorful characters, great production stuff, and excellent moments that you're totally missing out on if you just write it off.

I'll grant that it has boring static gameplay, lopsided editing, and the terrible RI twist but it's also the most darkly fascinating season ever, with a great cast and some of the most raw emotional moments ever on survivor. The cult aspect is some of the darkest and deepest sociologically survivor has gone since 2005. A strong cast even with uneven editing.

Overall, I give it a solid B grade. Don't let the hate drive you away from it.",13
23.0,"South
Pacific",crlvhu6,"Okay, we've officially reached the bottom of my Survivor barrel. Without question, this is the worst season of all time for me.

Problems: 

* It has a very stupid twist. It didn't work the first time, so why would it work the second time? All it does is waste 15 minutes per episode and minimizes the effect of each tribal council.

* The cast has a blatant example of nepotism, giving us someone who should have never been cast.

* People give the pre-merge props? Personally, it's still a dull string of episodes with a lot of strategy, just bad strategy.

* The post-merge is just painful. So much so that even the producers know it and try to condense the episodes, though it's still dull, even with the constant attempts at adding false suspense.

* The editing is pretty weak. While there are some people that could have had some potential as great characters, the edit doesn't give them enough time for me to care.

* It isn't a major factor, but even the challenges are pretty weak this season. They basically proved save one or two challenges, the only things the challenge department could do is dull carnival games or just base a challenge around coconuts.

* Possibly my biggest problem with the season is the format. The season focuses around two returning players, one per tribe. In S11 there was a good justification for it based on their story in the previous season. In S22 they used the format to settle a rivalry from two seasons prior. Here, they get two contestants that had possibly never met prior to the season, with two players that have almost no similarity in gameplay or from a character standpoint.

* Going back to the returning players, they both destroy their legacies in a major way. One of them goes from being arguably the most entertaining character of all time to becoming a dull game-bot, while the other returner has an ego that manages to get so large that they could probably film a season there.

* The cast isn't good either. Anyone that had potential as a good character had no edit, while the people we saw were basically unbearable. It's the only season I've seen where I have no one to root for.

* The season also has a heavy thematic feature that just got to a point where it became over bearing.

**TL;DR Overall, the best thing I can say about the season as a whole is that one guy has an incredible moustache. It's the best part about the season by far.**",9
23.0,"South
Pacific",crlg76t,"South Pacific featured the same two twists that its predecessor Redemption Island did: Two tribes which each had one returning player on it, and Redemption Island itself. The results in terms of fan reaction were ultimately similar to S22 (currently in dead last on this ranking and I don't expect that to change).

That said, South Pacific does have its moments. The cast was still poorly edited, but this time some of them were actually people as opposed to simply being drones. And the final couple of episodes weren't quite enough to redeem the entire season, but they definitely made for good viewing in a vacuum.

Downsides of the season include [a Pagonging](/spoiler) (not to the extent of RI but it's there), the continued existence of Redemption Island, and [a bizarre invocation of religion in order to keep one alliance unified.](/spoiler) Seriously, it was almost like a cult at points. 

It's probably the best of the three seasons in the 22-24 mini Dark Age, but at the end of the day it's nowhere near a must-see.",8
23.0,"South
Pacific",crlhotq,"It's not without merit. But it's not really very good either. The cast is just... fine? Not super inspiring. But the way they allow the season to play out just really kills a lot of potential entertainment value. 

Would I recommend it? No. But again, if you're running low on seasons to watch, you can do worse than this. It has one or two genuinely great tribals, some decent moments and the very end of the season is fun and funny and exciting. It's just not fully worth the price of admission.

23.0,"South

...problem is that they're all supporting characters, *including the winner.* It's not quite so bad when you're not watching live and coming off the heels of S22, but it still has Redemption Island taking the punch out of every episode, it still has obnoxious editing, it still plays out in a super unsatisfying way. I think there are some sort of worthwhile background characters, but overall it's really not worth the time. It does have some vocal fans, though, so check it out at some point and maybe you'll think it's underrated, and I *do* think the winner and immediate pre-FTC boot are very much worth watching. But there's really no reason to watch this one too early in your viewing experience.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 23/27

**Overall verdict:** It's not irredeemable, it has some good stuff that you're missing out on if you haven't watched it yet. But it has so much bad stuff that I really don't think it should be your first or 10th or 20th choice on how to spend ten hours of your life.

Most of the jury were either drones, props, or unlikable (mileage may vary on some of them). Furthermore, another one of the contestants was probably the single most loathsome, repulsive player we've ever had. 

I take this season a little too personally because the poor quality made it likely that one of the more interesting twist ideas we've had  (two tribes living on the same beach from the very start) will probably not make another appearance. At least there was no Redemption Island.",9
24.0,One World,crlpgnd,"I think this one is better when you know how it ends, won't be expecting the winner to get dethroned, and can focus on the episodic storylines and backing characters. And I certainly think it's MUCH easier to enjoy when you're not watching it right after 22/23. I did like it on the rewatch.

However, I liked it about as mildly as I can like a Survivor season. (Hopefully I'm not disproved on that, because I'm *so* over mediocre seasons.) It has no real zomgstandout contestants, and it has four that I really can't stand, all of whom are pretty major characters. It has no real long-term storylines. It just has a fair amount of kind of decent episodes that make me think ""Well, that was sort of okay. And now I don't care.""

I don't think it deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as RI or Caramoan. I don't think it'd be received as negatively if it hadn't come off the heels of two other really unpopular seasons. But I certainly don't think it's anywhere near the quality I expect from this show, either, and I don't think there's much reason to watch it unless you've already seen like 20 seasons and are trying to catch 'em all.

The edit is so disjointed and horrible: almost all of the time is spent on obnoxious characters being shoved down your throats, you're beaten over the head with one forced fan favorite in the post-merge whether you like them or not, and the contestants who *aren't* given these major caricatured edits are *almost invariably* made into totally neutral gamebots, given completely random storylines that change erratically with 0 explanation, or just simply ignored.

So there is a slim chance of you being one of the people who walk away from this season thinking parts of it were okay. But honestly, this is the only season that I'd say you reaaaaally don't need to watch.

But it has one thing that’s absolutely perfect, and that is THE CAST. Without a doubt, far and away my favorite cast Survivor has ever produced. Every single one of them fills their role incredibly well, and every single one of them feels like an important part of the season — something practically unheard of from any season after the first 3 or 4. It’s just a collection of interesting people doing interesting things, interacting in fun ways, and just being one big fun group of people. The location and integration with the culture is the best Survivor has ever done. One nighttime challenge requires the players to create a Chinese fireworks display, and later some of them go to the Great Wall of China and the Shaolin Temple — I mean, how freaking cool is that??? Fuck. I feel like I should rank this season even higher than I do. If you don’t want to start with Borneo, this is definitely best choice. It isn’t too complicated strategically (but it isn’t too stagnant, either — there are definitely some shakeups and unpredictable moments), it’s just a brilliant collection of characters with a balanced edit and very satisfying winner.

As the 15th season, China is smack-dab in the middle of the current Survivor canon, and it is a really excellent blend of ""old"" and ""new"" school, showcasing many of the games newer mechanics, such as Hidden Immunity Idols, in a way that is easy for a new viewer to understand. The game has enough zigs and zags  to keep things unpredictable without the progression of the game becoming hard to follow. It also manages to keep the ""old school"" charm, thanks to an exceptional 16 person cast. All of China's castaways have distinct, unique characterizations and roles to play in the story, which makes identifying and learning the players easy and uncomplicated. A lot of the conflict in the game is also fueled by the difficulty of the conditions and the reality of daily survival.

It has a great location, it has exciting moments, it has lots of likable and memorable contestants... It's one of the most well-rounded seasons.

What I think makes China especially valuable is its role as **a blend of older and newer Survivor.** It wouldn't be the first one that I'd suggest to start someone at, because season one exists (and even aside from chronology, that one has never failed me in getting someone into the show.) But as far as China itself goes, it's definitely a strong season with no real holes or weirdness that contains pretty much everything that's good about the show. It has some great cultural stuff and is a fairly character-driven season with balanced editing, like a lot of the earlier ones, but it has the twists and strategic focus of a later season. So *if* you want to start with a much later season in the show's run, then this one would almost certainly be be your best bet - this one or Gabon. It manages to simultaneously feel more old-school than anything since Palau *and* more modern than anything that came before it, so even if it is not absolutely outstanding all the time, it is a great exhibition of what the show has to offer.

**My Personal Ranking:** 16/29

**Overall verdict:** Well-rounded season that's good at everything and bad at nothing. If you're going to start with modern Survivor (which, again, not really my recommendation because that's just sort of ignoring years and years of the show - but *if!* you disagree with me there), then this or Gabon is the best place to start; I'd recommend Gabon over China, but if you want strong strategic players, China is a better pick.

[Dreamz fits your description; black guy, homeless at one point. At the final 6 of Fiji, another guy, Yau-Man (think Tai from this season but more into science) won a challenge for a car. Knowing Dreamz was homeless and desperate for a car, Yau-Man offered the car to Dreamz, and in exchange, if Dreamz won immunity at final 4 and they were both still in the game, Dreamz would give the necklace to Yau-Man. Now there's a bit more to this; behind the scenes, it's been stated that everyone else would've just given Dreamz the car; only Yau-Man tried to get something for himself out of it. But we don't know for sure if that's true. Anyway, Dreamz tried to get Yau-Man out over the next two rounds, but failed and ended up in the F4 with Yau-Man, where he won immunity. Dreamz did not follow through on the deal, Yau-Man was voted out in 4th. Dreamz talked in his speech at FTC about being homeless and how the game was about lies and deceit and he did what he had to do to get to the end, but he ended up getting no votes.](/spoiler)

The pre-merge alone is amazing with its tragic narrative. One player in particular is on the shortlist of all-time great pre-mergers. Their story of struggle is perfectly portrayed, and ends so brutally that editors should have played the Rains of Castamere during that scene.

The post-merge is equally great, but for different reasons. It plays out like a classic sports postseason game. There are so many strong, likeable characters who duke it out in an impressive showing of strategy and challenge-performances. Half a dozen people feel like they could be the winner. There are HUGE strategic shifts, great villains, skilled heroes, and one of the all-time best and most chaotic tribals at the F10.

Philippines is a no-brainer top 10 season. Watch it sooner than later. You will not be disappointed.

25.0,Philippines,cy6p3rd,"NOTE: This season contains returning players from seasons 2, 13/16, and 19. In a season like HvV, most of the seasons that the returnees come from are absolute must-watches; here, it isn't quite as important, and you can probably get a lot out of it without seeing the previous seasons beforehand. Still, it gives away very direct spoilers for those seasons, so if you care about that, don't watch it until you've seen the seasons listed above. Either way, I wouldn't recommend watching it before those anyway unless you really want to.

Easily my favorite post-HvV season. The first few episodes are fucking fantastic, with some of the most raw and emotional moments the show has given us in years, and you really get attached to one group of players in particular. Later on, the season is filled with great heroes, villains, and everything in between. I’m usually not a fan of seasons with 2 or 3 returnees, but this season nailed it down very well; the choices all came in with something to prove and were chosen for the right reasons, and here, they are part of the story, not THE story. Some great tribal councils, solid editing, unpredictability, and a solid cast, I can’t say anything bad here. One of the most universally popular seasons for a reason.

There are villains, comedic characters, heroes, all the elements for a great season.

It's a beautiful ray of sunshine during what most consider to be a streak of some of the worst seasons of Survivor (S22-26). It brought back the three-tribe format to fantastic results, and even though S25 was the first time three tribes had been used since S8, they've used it several times since.

A note on the returnees: Philippines has three returning castaways from Season 2, 13/16, and 19. While it doesn't spoil the results of these seasons, it does spoil the manner in which these characters each exited the game. In particular, I STRONGLY recommend watching at least through the pre-merge of S2 and still recommend watching the other three seasons or, at the very least, highlight reels or clips from the featured returnees.",4

---

*Tier: Top*

----

**Cast:** Well-cast for sure. Even the early boots make quite the impression. The three returnees all make the season better by being a part of it, and each have their own stories that weave through the season and bring many great moments. Not a single player stood out as poorly cast. A few were lackluster perhaps, but nobody sucked or made the season worse by being there.

**Twists**: The twist was bringing three tribes back for the first time since All-Stars, and boy was that a good choice! That special dynamic coupled with the medevac returnee twist made Philippines into the great season the survivor fan-base knows it for.

**Shining Light:** There's something for everybody. The colors are vibrant, the humor is on point, predictability isn't too high, chaos runs rampant straight to the finale, the whole season is one big shining light, illuminating different elements each time. 

**You Should Watch If:** You like The Facts of Life, or the Giants. You're a fan of Modern Survivor. You want to see great characters. You've felt bad for players who lost due to medical evacuations. You were chosen by god to watch survivor, and losing isn't an option. 

**One Word:** Brilliant

**Final Words:** The season is consistently great, but not the absolute best. It has a few dull moments pre-merge, and a few post-merge as well, but all in all this is a Top 10 season without a doubt.

25.0,Philippines,cy712jr,"(**RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!!:** Contains players from seasons 2, 13, 16, and 19, and contains very direct spoilers for some major moments from those seasons.)

Philippines was SO FUCKING AWESOME to watch live after 22-24. On the rewatch, though, it did go down for me a little bit. The first four episodes are so, SO good, but I think it loses a lot of steam after that, and I think the post-merge should have been edited waaaay differently.

Some big problems with the storytelling prevent me from ranking this one too high, but it's still a largely agreeable season, definitely worth watching at some point, a fine addition to the pool of Survivor seasons. But I think there are many better seasons and that it might not be received *as* positively if more people rewatched seasons, since I've already seen its reputation go down dramatically even in the time since it aired.

In any case, though, don't start with this one, because it has maaajor spoilers for previous seasons, and some of its big stories are more satisfying when you know who those players are.

**My Personal Ranking:** 15/29

**Overall verdict:** Solid season that's worth watching, but I think it's better right after 22-24 and should have been edited way differently. It's pretty good but I don't think it's the standout many people do or see any real reason to jump at this one compared to many other modern seasons - particularly when there are returning players. Definitely way more satisfying and less spoiler-y when you've seen its returning players' original seasons.",3
25.0,Philippines,cy6tp25,"Philippines is a season that is emblematic of everything great with Modern Survivor. Many long time fans find some of the newer additions to the game to be hit-or-miss, but this season makes use of many of them in a great way. This is the season that really popularized the three-tribe format, which is becoming more and more likely to be Survivor's new norm. The hidden immunity idols are also used well in this story, as are the returning players featured in Philippines. Most of the cast members are new players, but each of the three tribes is joined by a previous castaway who was evacuated due to medical reasons in their prior attempt at the game. It's not only the returning castaways who bring a lot to this season, however--you'll see a lot of the new players develop unique personalities and storylines, and many of them play *hard* to win. From an editing perspective, this season does a really good job at juggling multiple potential victors, so that you don't enter the final episode feeling like you've already known for weeks who is winning. It's not just the winner contenders who deliver either--this season's primary antagonist is a modern classic, someone who you will either love to hate or secretly love to love. ",2

If I had to pick a season to show somebody just to get them started on the show, I wouldn't start with Pearl Islands because it's so awesome that even some other great seasons will feel underwhelming if you have Pearl Islands as a baseline.

Let's blow this one out of the fucking park"", and succeeded even beyond their own wildest dreams.

Most of the time, I'll explain my opinions super in-depth. But sometimes, absolutely nothing that I or anyone else could ever say could possibly compare to the thing itself. Pearl Islands, the pinnacle of Survivor, is one such time. You could not write a better Survivor season than Pearl Islands. You could not even write Pearl Islands or people would tell you to fuck off with something that unrealistic.

So I'm not even going to elaborate. I'm not going to say one word about what makes Pearl Islands so great. Just watch it. Go into it knowing as little as you can, and bask in the overwhelming wonder and beauty and perfection that is almost unequivocally Survivor's greatest season.

*(That said, I don't think it should be your first one. Even outside of the chronological order, my support for which I will always wave in your face, I think starting with Pearl Islands is a pretttttty bad idea. A lot of its biggest moments will pack a much harder punch if you realize just how unorthodox they are. I know that the hype makes it tempting, but don't just dive into this one.)*

There’s one really bizarre editing choice in the premerge that still makes no sense to me (saying any more would spoil it, but I’m not a fan of it), but other than that, there’s not a whole lot to dislike about it. Has one absolutely incredible character and some pretty good background ones as well. I’m not a huge fan of the winner and find them to be pretty bland, so maybe that’s part of why I don’t like this season as much as some people, but overall it’s a pretty solid, agreeable all-around season in an absolutely stunning location.

18.0,Tocantins,cy6ty5t,"Tocantins is similar to China in that it's a comparatively modern season that has a number of classic elements well represented, and is a good season for a new viewer who is still learning the ins and outs of the game. (Well, for the most part. Exile Island this season is a little bit complicated, but not so much that it makes the season convoluted or hard to watch). The story is carried by a strong cast of characters. There are definitely a handful of them who will appeal to fans who are very interested in game strategy, as well as a few who will be well liked by those who watch to laugh. There is one main character in particular who is very divisive--some fans think this person is a riot, while others find them supremely annoying. It all depends on your ability to handle delusional people. 

This is also maybe the last season where the location itself is like a character. The tropical savanna of the Jalapao region is absolutely beautiful to watch in HD and is unlike any other place Survivor has ever played. This was the last time the show went to an inland location, sadly. 

If I had to pick a possible negative, it's the pace of the season. Some viewers may find that Tocantins moves slowly in the beginning, so you need to have patience--the events of the pre-merge are all part of careful stage setting for the merge and onward.",6

18.0,Tocantins,cy70jgj,"Tocantins is an interesting one. In most fan circles I visit, its reception is pretty lukewarm; some people dislike it and find it boring, some quite like it, most think it was just kind of decent. But here, people *freaking love Tocantins.* I don't really know what about it makes it more popular here than elsewhere, or what about /r/survivor makes them like it more.

I think it's a pretty agreeable season, though, with not many underedited contestants, a largely old-school format, a very satisfying boot order and winner/F2, and lots of good characters. I really don't have any distinct complaints about it, but I also think that almost everything it does right, lots of other seasons do better, while also doing more strong things of their own. I don't think it's enough of a standout to be worth a *super* early viewing.

I especially would avoid it first because one contestant in particular is... so weird and *so* unlike anyone or anything on most other seasons. I mean, he's fucking awesome. But he's also not a great representation of or introduction to the show.

If you're interested in watching more modern ones, Tocantins is maybe a good, like, third or fourth season to check out or something, to get you more into the show before seeing better seasons. But I wouldn't start with it.

**My Personal Ranking:** 18/29, but I can't really remember why I liked it less on my most recent viewing, and I loved it at the time, so I'll probably rewatch it soon and see whether it should rank higher.

**Overall verdict:** Fun, agreeable season. A little weird in some aspects and too lacking in standout aspects to be the *first* season you watch, but it could be a good early pick if you're starting with modern ones.",4
18.0,Tocantins,cyalmqk,"**Tomandgreek's Season Overview**

---

*Tier: Top*

----

**Cast:** Excellent cast, something that is universally agreed upon by survivor fans. One specific player is one of the absolute greatest characters to grace our television screens, so captivating that they make Tocantins what it is. With that in mind, be prepared for perhaps the most perfectly cast season of Survivor ever, at least in my opinion.

**Twists**: Exile with idol clue. Exile is huge this season, and gives rise to one of Survivor's best episodes ever in conjunction with a fantastic character. There's also a first-impression twist in episode one that sets the season into action from the get go.

**Shining Light:** The cast makes the season what it is. Certain characters are so fun to watch that you stop caring whether strategy is being developed and care more about what these individuals are doing and saying. You can pop some popcorn and enjoy the show.

**You Should Watch If:** You want an old-school feeling season with modern hints (and in HD).  You're prepared to become addicted and have the time to binge. You don't give a shit about water challenges. You like character-driven seasons. You are a human being with eyes and access to this season.

**One Word:** Amusing

**Final Words:** It took me a long time to get around to watching this season, but when I did I wanted to watch it a second time immediately. I think it's a season the likes of which we shall never see again, but that makes it so much more special.

Really, Panama has everything - great cast, tons of humor, fun challenges, intriguing new twists that don't do TOO much to affect the game, and iconic moments, both strategic and not.

The gameplay is fairly standard, but one particular contestant really comes into their own as one of the greatest strategists of all time with a particularly brilliant move late in the game — and this contestant is amazing in more ways than just gameplay. A really solid cast, strong editing and, above all, funny moments, far outweigh the collection of weird twists, and it’s a solid season that just about everyone can sit down and enjoy.

12.0,Panama,cy6zbgq,"Panama is my pick for the all-time funniest Survivor season - though 17 and 21 could give it a run for its money. One of its two tribes (you'll be able to tell which one pretttttttty quickly) is maybe the single most revered tribe in Survivor fandom, and ""revered"" isn't an exaggeration. Pretty much all the best, wackiest, most dynamic characters ended up on one tribe by sheer happenstance, which gives us enough hilarity throughout the season to overshadow some of the kind of awkward and unnecessary twists. (With its format and twists, I think Panama *should* have been kinda awful - but it turned out to be too fucking hilarious to be awful.)

If you're more into strategy, Panama provides that as well. It births a contestant who's widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of Survivor - and they also happen to be maybe the most likable character of the season, an absolutely perfect combination. Their journey alone would make the whole season worth watching even if it *weren't* fucking hilarious besides that... so when you add all of that together, you have a season that ranked in my top 10 until very recently, ranks in very many people's, and is generally just an entertaining season. That I think 10 seasons are better just speaks to the overall quality of this franchise. Watch it.

**My Personal Ranking**: 11/29

**Overall verdict**: A simple, fun season that will keep you smiling, that will keep you interested, and that it's really hard to complain about, due to having one of the oddest assortments of characters in Survivor history.

Luckily, this tribe doesn't get much screen time, and once the merge hits, this season becomes ten times greater.

12.0,Panama,d0x0hp5,"Just finished S12. I've been watching all seasons chronologically, and went in completely blind.

This season was very interesting. It held my attention throughout the whole season, but nothing was really spectacular enough to make this season stand out. This seemed like the first season where I didn't feel like I ""recognized"" the challenges. As far as I can tell, Survivor pretty much uses the same challenges every season, but changes how they look (I.E. the tribe voting for most spirited, most dangerous, 3 strikes you're out challenge), and while this season did have a few that matched up with a past challenge, I felt like they really did try some new stuff. Some worked, and some didn't. I really, really didn't like the final immunity challenge for example, and wish they had stuck to the similar layout of the past.

The cast is really something else. I don't really know how to explain it without giving too much away, but I could find myself hating a survivor one episode and liking them the next. LOTS of different characters, and I'm sure one for everyone, but similar to the challenges, none of them really stuck out for me, other than one, who seemed impossible to hate.

28.0,Cagayan,cy6oxjn,"I would strongly recommend **NOT** starting with this season as your first. Not that it’s a bad season or anything, but it’s very new-school in the sense that the game is so developed at this point; there’s lots of talk of vote splits and idols and strategy that might be confusing to a new viewer. Just as importantly, if someone starts with this season first, they will likely get accustomed to it and expect every season to be just as hyperactive (and I bring this up because I figure it is going to place very high on this list, and is often recommended when people ask which season to watch). 

As for my options on Cagayan itself… the premerge was fantastic with one of the greatest trainwrecks of a tribe of all time, lots of memorable voteoffs, good character moments and just tons of hilarious stuff in general. It also has one of the best casts of the last 5 or so years. After the merge, however, the editing really takes a sharp turn, shifting the main focus onto talk of big moves and highlighting two players; one of whom I like as a personality, but am not a fan of the way their story was told, and the other who has tons of huge fans and tons of huge haters who I don’t really care for either way. So when those are the two biggest characters, I can’t really get into the postmerge as much. Also, one postmerge twist is just absolutely horrendous and never, ever should have happened. Still, it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end, and if you love strategy talk and the two aforementioned characters, it will probably wind up in your top 5.

28.0,Cagayan,cy71tko,"My most recent rewatch and *wow* my opinion of it tanked. Thought it could rank as high as my top ten before the rewatch, and now it is hardly in my top twenty. The premiere is amazing, the merge episode is  great , and everything between them is alright. Then it absolutely tanks. Before my rewatch, I'd heard people say it went downhill after the merge, but I was not prepared for how much. There is just *nothing* of almost any interest in the F10-F7 episodes, the F6 episode is dynamic but a pretty miserable and pointless watch due to the baffling earlier revival of one of the worst and most unpopular twists ever... and episode three is also pretty slow, so that's half the season. It mildly picks up in the last two episodes - but only to the level of being *good,* not to anything *great* that can redeem the rest of the merge.

So I don't get the hype here at all. With something like Cambodia, I can get why people like it more than I do if they're watching for different things, and I can get that for some of the episodes here, but for the most part I don't understand it. I don't think any overall aspect of this season stands out compared to other seasons; it has some great moments, but it has an awful twist, some lame editing, and a really dead streak in the post-merge.

In any case, even aside from my personal opinion of it as a resounding ""meh"", **I definitely wouldn't recommend it first.** It's almost as modern as modern Survivor gets and very misleading about what the show has to offer, so if you are not going chronologically, you'd be better served starting with a Gabon or a China that blends newer and older stuff, and I also think the particular game and edit of this winner are sort of misleading about what traits are typically rewarded.

I'd imagine the only people who haven't seen a season as recent and hyped as this one are ones who haven't seen pretty much any seasons, and in addition to being a season I think is really lackluster overall, it's *so* ""modern"" with such an anomalous winner that I don't think it's a good introduction to the show.

**My Personal Ranking:** 19/29

**Overall verdict:** Some decent characters and a strong pre-merge make it an okay viewing experience overall, but too much dead space and too regrettable a central post-merge twist to be anywhere close to one of the better seasons in the show's run, and would make for a very misleading introduction to a new viewer.",12
28.0,Cagayan,cy7ld97,"Cagayan is great, but like others have mentioned, it's like a big blockbuster season. A Marvel franchise that rakes in 500 million in one weekend, compared to San Juan Del Sur being an indie film that goes onto win Oscars, if you will.

It's still fantastic, but I recently rewatched it, and almost felt a bit gluttonous. 

It's a sugar rush of a season. Enjoy it, but don't make yourself sick. ",4
28.0,Cagayan,cy7awfe,"The pre-merge and merge episodes are amazing. The cast is good and there is a lot of fun moments. But when the post-merge happens, it goes downhill. The majority of the focus is given to two people and most of the airtime they receive is just them talking about IDOLZZZZ, BIG MOVEZZZZ, AND BLINDSIDEZZZ. It got old really fast and because of that I wasn't as invested in the season as I was compared to how I was when watching the pre-merge.

My ranking: 14/31.",3

28.0,Cagayan,cy6xtoe,"Some of the glitter has faded since it's original airing, sure, but Cagayan is a great season of Survivor. This season begins the game with three tribes, divided by core character traits: Brains, Beauty, and Brawn. If you are here for the ""modern"" show--a season where a lot of the castaways are using their confessional time to share their strategies and gameplay ideas with the viewers--then Cagayan is among the best. It blends the focus on strategy with a diverse cast of intriguing characters, and it's one of the few seasons where you really don't ever feel confident that you *know* who the winner is. If you're looking for a season that has a more nuanced story and complex characters, Cagayan probably won't be your favorite. While on the whole, everybody gets screentime and has a role to play, some episodes are heavily dominated by a few polarizing lead characters. You'll often see longtime fans decry ""new school"" seasons as being bad, but let's just set the record straight that different =/= bad. Cagayan is a decidedly new school season, but it highlights some of the most fun elements of new school Survivor. Given that it is, however, such a ""new school"" season, watch with caution if you pick this season early on--it may set an expectation that the older seasons won't be able to live up to. This is a season that has gotten a *lot* of people into the show, especially people who don't really know that Survivor is much more of a strategy game than a melodrama about eating bugs.",2

It has big characters who are more than willing to take risks for the sake of their own advancement, one of (IMO) the greatest confessionalists Survivor has ever seen, and a theme that delineates the tribes nicely, yet isn't rammed down our throat as much as it is in later seasons. Probably the best display of new school Survivor.",2

Probably a prerequisite if you're going to watch Cambodia, but that's the only reason I can think of to recommend it.",2

God tier season.",1
28.0,Cagayan,cy7e6ce,"This season can best be described as a breath of fresh air. Seasons 22-27 were either boring, filled with returnees, or both, to the point where Survivor was starting to feel more like a reality show akin to Keeping up with the Kardashians. This season, being the first since 24 to feature all new players, felt like the beginning of a new age of survivor: Half of the players were fans of the show that came to play hard, and as a result, this season featured some of the most complex strategy to date. The premerge is fascinating to watch thanks to one of the three tribes being the worst in survivor history, and the postmerge is just as great, with some of the best tribal councils and drama the series has ever seen. Overall a solid, solid new school season of survivor.",1

I don't think that it ruins other seasons, sure they have a different rate of play but there are impressive players for other reasons in all the other seasons too. I think if you are getting into the game because you want to crack the code of how to win this immense and perfectly balanced game, Cagayan is a pretty good place to start.",1

This season also maintains its theme of Pacific War wreckage very well throughout.",28

10.0,Palau,cy6zo67,Palau is a fucking shakespearean tragedy,13
10.0,Palau,cy7c1kc,"An absolutely remarkable end to Survivor’s first 10 seasons and my personal favorite season ever.   Palau has a ton of things going for it.


First of all it has a fantastic military theme that shows throughout the show.  Only Pearl Islands and China are comparable in terms of how much they stuck with the theme.  This leads to probably the best challenges throughout all of Survivor occurring in this season.  Every challenge is exciting to watch and you can feel the military vibes emanating throughout the cast while they’re performing in these challenges.  They are brutal, intense and absolutely thrilling to watch.  The theme also extends to the theme song and even the story of the season.

Second of all it has a really strong cast accentuated by an absolutely fantastic boot order.  Similar to Vanuatu and Borneo, most of the weak members of the cast leave fairly early, leading to an endgame of the strongest, most complex characters.  My personal favorite Survivor is on the cast and at least two others would be contenders for my top 30.  

Third, and most important of all for me, Palau has a great central story that is absolutely breathtaking to watch unfold.  All of its characters fit very nicely into an awesome, very real narrative, culminating in my favorite moment in all of Survivor history.  I’m having a really hard time talking about Palau without spoiling it but its central story is wonderful.

There are some understandable gripes people have with this season.  Palau is not a fun season to watch (though I contend it has more fun moments than people give it credit for).  It is brutal and some parts of it are near uncomfortable to watch.  It also has some twists that aren’t fantastic. 

I also wouldn’t recommend watching this first.  There are a lot of things that happen in Palau that need some context to fully appreciate this.  I would recommend this season to anybody who appreciates primarily the characters on Survivor, as it is truly top-notch when it comes to portraying its cast as human beings, rather than simply players like many modern seasons.  If you want a season that reminds you that the castaways on Survivor are real human beings, I’d say Palau is your best bet, as there is no cast that is portrayed quite as realistically as Palau’s.",7

The post-merge in particular is extraordinarily deep, creating unbelievably complex characters. We get a great underdog, amazing inter-contestant relationships, a badass winner, and one of the most human moments in all of Survivor. The challenges are the most difficult ever featured, with a slight military theme, and are incredibly fun to watch. Both original tribes featured are memorable and hold important places in the Survivor pantheon. On top of this, Palau contains great strategy from the final 6 on, one of the most darkly compelling episodes of all time, that would later inspire a future twist, and a 10/10 finale. While it is a bit of an acquired taste, if you can get used to it, Palau will not disappoint.",3

The players don’t seem to be enjoying themselves very often, the game takes a toll on some of them like no other season has done, and the ending is one of the darkest we have ever seen. But god damn it, I’d be lying if I didn’t say I loved nearly every second of it. Shit gets REAL in this season. As I said, it isn’t fun. But it is INTENSE. And it is truly one of a kind. Possibly the most iconic female hero of all time is in this season, as well as one of the most likable winners — who I’d say is a strong contender for best player ever. Saying more about why I love this season so much would be kind of spoilerery, so I’ll stop here. But if you haven’t seen it, watch it. Strategically, emotionally, and physically, this season is a doozy. And it’s pretty fucking compelling.

10.0,Palau,d0hu3pw,"This season was.... weird. Probably my absolute favorite pre-merge. Pre-merge was GOOOOOOOOLD. I rooted for both sides the entire time, in all types of challenges. I don't think there was a single survivor this season I truly disliked.

Post-merge kind of killed my vibe for this season, but just because it was so starkly different from pre-merge. The strategy just seemed so.... all over the place. One moment it seems like the castaways know what they're doing, the next I'm basically facepalming at some decisions. 

This gets even more obvious as the season goes on. Absolutely the weirdest F5 of the seasons I've seen so far, and from then on things just went the opposite of how I would expect them to. (THIS IS NOT A BAD THING). Final episode is fairly iconic for certain things that will become obvious as you watch. 

The only thing that kind of rubbed me wrong about this season was the final tribal. It should've and could've gone VERRY differently had the F2 played their cards a bit different in final tribal, and this even gets brought up briefly in the reunion. It's hard to explain without giving anything away, but WATCH WATCH WATCH this season. Phenomenal.

Palauish, to avoid spoilers, to be a good introduction to the show. But once you're into the show a bit, watch it. It's definitely, *deffffinitely* a high point of the franchise with some shocking, compelling, emotional storylines and entertaining characters, a very popular/respected winner (whose story is probably enhanced by chronological viewing), probably the best challenges ever in Survivor (I don't give a shit about challenges 9 times out of 10 and I *still* love Palau's), and a brilliant military theme that helps to set it apart from other ones. I think it also benefits even more from a second viewing (and then a third... and then a fourth...) And the finale in particular is just otherworldly amazing. If that finale, that Final Immunity Challenge and its buildup, don't blow your *fucking mind* then I don't know what will. (Well, except Pearl Islands, since it blows *everyone's* mind.

**Overall verdict**: Again, I don't want to run the risk of spoiling, so I can't say much here. But I'll just say that it's one of my absolute favorites, it's a totally *brilliant* season with a lot of great stuff, and you won't regret watching it.

This is the first season to feature 20 castaways, so be prepared for some of them to get shafted when it comes to airtime and storylines--there are definitely some people in this season who don't have a whole lot to do other than float in the background. That being said, the lead characters are deeply complex and beautifully fleshed out. You have romance, heartbreak, passion, betrayal, heroics, sass, self-discovery, and triumph all in one season. Definitely worth watching, especially if you've already seen a few seasons and are looking for something really unlike what you've seen before.",2

The winner is one of the best ever imo and the runner is one I find underrated as a player and character. The only minor critic is maybe the slow premerge, but it never really impacted me much.

29.0,"San Juan

29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",cy6qo7e,"Survivor: San Juan del Sur is the perfect mix of strategy and characters. 

The gameplay is very frenetic in this season while having foreseeable interpersonal and strategic reasons for what occurs. 

I have no idea what to say about the plot that won’t spoil some aspect of the fantastic narrative, but I will say that every part of the major overarching storyline is carefully being built up from the very beginning, but none of it is obvious in the beginning stages.

Like other good seasons, the characters on this season are dynamic and develop throughout and their personalities are deeply entwined with the plot. Each character has their hour (with one/two exceptions). There is a brilliant hero and a domineering villain, but they certainly aren’t who you’d think they’d be. 

That leads me to my main point: San Juan del Sur is an awe-inspiring series of subversions, and there’s something waiting under the surface in this cast of innocuous people

Also, this season is really funny.  

Twists:

Blood VS. Water: Each player has a loved one that they are very close to from real life playing on the opposite tribe.

Exile Island: A player will be exiled nearly every episode to an isolated place (pre-merge they can bring one other player from the opposite team) where they won’t be able to talk to their allies, but there is a hidden immunity idol hidden there.

**This season is fairly strategically advanced, so I would not recommend for a first season; however, it is a very good choice to showcase modern gameplay.**

Common complaints with this season are that:

A) It starts out slow, and this is sort of true. A lot of action in the beginning stages looks like it’s going nowhere fast. That being said, there are great things happening even in the beginning episodes, and the other details will pay their dividends in subsequent stages of the season.

B) The characters are unorthodox. This is true, and people had a hard time accepting during its original airing that these people were actually fun and interesting. Please open your heart though. 

It is my favorite season.",24
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",cy71wqi,"I really, really, really like SJDS. I think it is one of the most well-rounded seasons. First off, I think that it's a largely character-driven narrative with a very balanced edit, so you're given a reason to care about pretty much everyone in the cast - a cast that I think is comprised of very likable and entertaining personalities. And these likable, entertaining people also happen to be maybe the smartest and most strategically proactive cast we've had in *years* - giving it some majorly shocking strategic moments and twists and impressive moves... made by, and involving, contestants who have been set up as more than just tepid gamebots but actual people you'll get invested in. So basically, it's entertaining people whose stories are told in a complex and interesting way and who then play freaking stellar and incredibly dynamic games... it succeeds on absolutely all fronts. I can't think of anything this season doesn't do right. And it has one of my favorite sets of endgamers in all of Survivor history. I really enjoyed almost every single member of the cast, and the ones I enjoyed the most all made it pretty far. I absolutely loved the winner, and two other contestants from this one probably rank in my all-time top 25, which is like unheard of for a modern season.

Some people think the pre-merge was slow, but I was more hyped after the premiere than I have been for any season maybe in my entire time watching, and I think that it really never lost steam after that; episode 2 was kinda ehh and had me worried, but it sets up some later events quite nicely and is a better episode in retrospect for moving the season along. Episode 6, too, is a little ehh but also a necessary evil for the boot order. Outside of that, I really, really enjoyed every single week - so when the worst thing I can say about a season is ""There were two episodes that aren't totally exciting on their own but still make the season better, and I actively enjoyed every other week""... fuck, that's probably a good season. 

I don't know, I just don't get why its reception was so lukewarm for some folks. I loved it. I thought it was a well-rounded season with excellent storytelling and characters - one that set up its story well, making its twists and turns even more fun. I thought it was very fun and satisfying pretty much every single week, and I definitely think it's worth watching and pretty much the high point of post-HvV Survivor. Excellent characters playing excellent and exciting games.

Now, I wouldn't *start* with it, because it comes along so late in the show's run and the BvW twist (which I thought was handled much better here than in S27) makes it different from most other seasons. But I think it might go down in Survivor history as a kind of ""meh"" season, deterring future people from watching it (though its reputation is starting to turn around in the online fanbase), which really sucks and I'd really like to be a voice of strong pro-S29 support and say that this one does pretty much everything right and should definitely be watched with a fair shot and open mind, even if it's not the best introduction to the show. And would make for a better introduction than virtually anything else post-HvV.

**My Personal Ranking:** 8/29

**Overall verdict:** Don't watch it *first* because BvW makes it really different story-wise from a lot of seasons, but if you haven't seen it (which most people on this sub probably have), you should totally check it out at some point. Excellent cast, excellent story, excellent strategy, all of which come together to give us one of the most satisfying seasons in years. Hell, one of the most satisfying ever, and *the* most satisfying in years. I feel like it's everything Cagayan gets praised for supposedly being and also so much more.",23

The post merge is absolutely amazing and the season concludes with my favourite finale ever. The season really snowballs momentum wise. People sometimes criticise the pre merge for being dull [something I didn’t struggle with on my watch] but in the end I think it helps by adding to the momentum which it gained by the end of the season. In my opinion this season blows the original Blood vs Water season away and it is definitely one of my all time favourites.",5
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",cy7ear1,"A season that would have been a lot better if it weren't for the twist. Blood vs. Water returns, but with only new players, has little justification. Ultimately, this twist only becomes a hindrance, making the season feel like a season with 9 players rather than 18.

That being said, there is a lot to like about this season. The postmerge, in particular, features great drama and some interesting tribal councils. Perhaps the best part of the season, though, is the winner; he/she is one of the most satisfying winners in Survivor history and has a game that is a blast to watch. ",5

Plus, SJDS still has some really great strategic moves, some of the all-time great funny Survivor moments, and an ultimately very satisfying winner.

A very good season for character development, as it’s one of the few modern seasons where most characters feel like they have a role in the story — some are more props in the stories of their loved ones than good characters themselves, but either way you do get to know pretty much all of them. The postmerge is excellent, with some very well-edited blindsides and funny character moments, and a very satisfying and agreeable winner. My main gripes with the season are the return of a twist that led to waaaaay too many immunity idols ending up the players’ pockets, and the attitudes towards the end do support the notion of “you have to make big moves to win Survivor”, but neither of those hurt the season that much. A season whose reputation has only gone up with time, I’d say it’s a very good season all-around.

The winner is one of my Top 5 winners of all time (they're in most people's Top 10 Lists), and every single episode, barring one or two, have had some hilarious moments.

Some people say that starting with SJDS isn't a good idea, but hell, if your friend might be somebody who **needs** a new school season because they cannot stand slow pacing and a lack of HD, why not SJDS? It has a great newbie cast, likeable people, and storylines which actually pay off emotional dividends.

I actually feel like I am now in the minority, however, in that I don't enjoy the season as a whole. Watch it for the late-game, the last few episodes are some of the best in recent memory. But the season takes so long to get there - the pre-merge is among the most boring in the series. Whether or not you enjoy this season as a whole will depend on your opinions of the cast - if you find yourself invested in them, this season may very well be one of your favorites.

It certainly isn't lacking when it comes to #bigmoves and #blindsides, but first and foremost this is a season driven by complex narratives and subtle relationships between its cast members.

Two should-be big time players try too hard too fast, and the result is pretty boring.

A pair that falls ass-backwards into a few key points of power make strategically unsound, and often poorly motivated, decisions.  The episode they didn't talk is one of the worst episodes in Survivor history imo.

1.0,Borneo,cy7357n,"Just iconic. I'm a media studies nerd, and Season 1 of Survivor is SO IMPORTANT for the landscape of modern television and for the future of Survivor as well. Survivor inspired basically every other reality competition show that has ever been on television, and it's incredibly telling to the legacy of Survivor in reality television that it was a Survivor: Borneo contestant who first said ""I'm not here to make friends."" To this day, the S1 castaways are still American icons. People who haven't watched Survivor since the early 2000s can still tell you who won Borneo and about a particularly epic moment in Final Tribal Council that might be the most infamous scene in Survivor ever.

The show today as we know it also doesn't exist without Borneo. The eventual winner and their gameplay set the stage for how the show would play out for years to come and set the ultimate precedent for what it takes to win Survivor, and plenty of people think the show would look different or would have been cancelled several seasons ago had someone else won.

Starting here and continuing on is the most satisfy way to go if you plan on watching the entire series. Watching the show evolve and change is so interesting, and it guarantees that you don't miss a single reference or parallel in the seasons to follow.",25
1.0,Borneo,cy6nxrj,"You should start with season, regardless of where else you go afterwards. It introduces the game to you, slowly, the building of how strategy came to be, and if you don't care about that, there are plenty of great characters that will entertain you. Some of the most universally beloved characters come from Borneo. Main gripe is challenges and rewards, they are a bit cheesy, but blame the budget. 

**Ranking 8/31**",10
1.0,Borneo,cy6wtck,"#I super strongly recommend that people start with this season and watch in order (even if not watching *every single* season.)

Honestly, I kinda have a problem with the whole conversation piece of ""I want to watch old seasons - so which ones are the best?"" Not that I blame people for asking it, or for answering it, but I just don't agree with the idea of watching based on which ones people say are ""the best."" And here's why:

* **There really is no objective ""the best"":** different people like and dislike different seasons, and **you don't know who you're going to agree with** until you watch them. There are probably some general trends, true, like odds are season twenty-two isn't going to be your favorite, and you're probably going to like season ten more than season twenty-four. But outside of the super extreme examples of really, really popular and unpopular seasons - as far as the middle, *most seasons,* go - opinions vary wildly (and they even do at the extremes for some people.) So if you say ""Hey, which seasons are the best?"", you're really just asking ""Which seasons happen to be popular among the people in this particular community who decided to look at and contribute to this particular thread?"" - which might not be indicative of what you'll end up agreeing with.

* If you go into a certain season knowing most people don't like it because you saved it for last or whatever, you're probably never really going to give it a fair shot, and ***every single* season has at least *something* that might be worth watching and has some defenders.** But **if you go into it assuming it'll suck,** then... your viewing experience will probably kinda suck.

* **I think it's kind of a spoiler in itself to say ""Oh this season is great! It's so unpredictable!""** Then you go into that season knowing that the dynamics are probably going to change at some point, that there'll be a major blindside of the person who seems to be in power or whatever. If you go in having no idea what'll happen either way, having no idea what people think and why, then it'll be the ultimate state of unspoiled-ness - you'll be a totally unspoiled blank slate. **And then when you end up watching one of the really freaking crazy seasons, you'll be like :OOO because you had no idea that they were going to be an unpredictable one.** When you watch a season live as it airs, you have virtually no idea whether it'll be good or bad; watching in an objective chronological order that isn't defined by ""good"" or ""bad"" recreates this aspect of the experience as much as possible.

* Context enhances every single season. Every single season is more powerful, for better or worse, when you can compare it to those that came around and came before it. **This is especially prevalent in the earliest seasons:** watching season 18 before season 17, when new kinds of strategy and dynamics have pretty much been locked down, probably won't matter that much. But watching season 26 before season 2 definitely does; even watching season 4 before 3 does.

* **The early seasons are a really different show than the most recent ones,** and you'll probably **enjoy that show more if you watch it first**... and enjoy the more recent show more if you've seen the previous seasons that laid its foundation. (This isn't to say ""Oh, the show was kind of okay at first but then it got REALLY good! So watch the mediocre early ones before you get spoiled by how great the show eventually is!"" or anything like that; I think all the best seasons were the earliest ones. But they're good in a kind of way that's sometimes harder to appreciate when you're only accustomed to later ones.)

If you're *totally* sure that you're not going to watch a bunch of Survivor and you're just into it more casually (which probably isn't the case for many people spending their time looking at a thread on here), and if you're gonna watch a few seasons then check out, then maybe it makes more sense to go with some of the most popular ones (although even then, for my money, 1/3/4 and 7 are the best in the franchise... but, of course, that's just my opinion.) Even then, though, I'd say whichever ones you're going to watch, it probably makes sense to watch them in order.

But **if you have any interest in *really* getting into the franchise, if you think that there's *any* chance that you might get really into the show and watch most or all of its seasons to date?** Then you should definitely, *deffffinitely* go for the full, chronological order that enhances every season, doesn't give you pre-conceived notions, and helps you really understand the development of the franchise.

And **even if you're only gonna watch a few seasons, I can't really think of any reason *not* to try the first one first.** As I'm gonna outline in just a sec, I think it's pretty fucking gr8 even on its own. If you don't enjoy it and you were looking for something more like the recent seasons, well, **no loss, you can move on to them** - but if you do enjoy it, then you can keep watching the older ones that most people appreciate more when they're watched earliest.

So for sosososo*soooo* many reasons, I think that everyone who thinks there's *any* chance of themselves really getting into the show should watch every season in order - or at least watch in order what they are going to watch. And I think that even people who won't get too into the show should at least start with 1.

#Now, even aside from all of that:

Even as a standalone viewing experience and leaving aside all the context and stuff, for those who might not watch much of the show? I still think this season is *totally* a **must-watch** one. It isn't just some weird dull historical thing that you should watch for the sake of enjoying later seasons more, at all; **it's some fucking fantastic television, and if I had to pick just one season to show somebody and they'd never see any other season ever, I would, utterly without question, pick this one.** Its **story** plays out in a brilliant way that's told beautifully, and along the way you get some of the biggest, best, funnest, most memorable moments and scenes of the franchise to date - culminating in perhaps the single biggest and greatest moment in the entire history of the show.

**The cast is just fantastic, too.** Keep in mind that the show wasn't a show yet; there was no indication of whether it'd be popular at all or, if so, among whom, so they put together a *remarkably* diverse cast here of people from all kinds of backgrounds who are all entertaining and interesting for a number of reasons - and then **they give each one a complete story.** There are none - none! - of the underedited ""purple"" characters you get in some later seasons, and nothing close to them. Every single person is built up, and you'll remember every single one when they go out, and none of them are given one-note ""villain"" edits that make them annoying.

I chose to include the ""Watch every season in order! And if you aren't watching every season, you should still watch in order!"" stuff here because I guess season one is the best place to put it, as opposed to a new top-level comment, and it's something I feel super strongly about and wanted to express. But I know that some people still might not be interested in that for whatever reason and want to just go with the ""highlights"" or ""best seasons"", so in my other comments I will explain what I think are the strong points of each season and why you should watch them, and which ones I think are the biggest ""must-watch"" seasons even if you aren't going to watch all of them. **The original ""Survivor"" is a *massive* strong point from the very beginning up through the very end, and absolutely the one must-watch to end all must-watches, even if you're not going to watch any other seasons.** It's just **utterly fantastic** television - there's a reason it managed to score *51.7 million viewers* (!!!) in the span of just a few months. Popularity doesn't always mean good, but in this case, it really freaking was an amazing product that transfixed people for a reason. To even call it a ""season of Survivor"" feels strange, because ""seasons of Survivor"" weren't a thing yet; there was just the one ""Survivor."" It was its own isolated little thing, and then 30 seasons branched off of it.

I think anyone who has *any* interest in US pop culture or television should watch this, absolutely without question - or anyone who enjoys watching things, because it's just fucking great. So certainly, *certainly* anyone who's interested in the franchise that it eventually launched should absolutely, absolutely watch this brilliant television experience. Seriously, this is just... amazing, the original ""Survivor"" is fucking incredible, and again, even if you don't care about the history or development of the show and aren't going to watch that much of it, there's still 0 reason to not watch this season. **It's so fucking satisfying and fulfilling that I don't even know where to begin; the entire product, start to finish, is utterly phenomenal. I honestly just find it hard to wrap my mind around the idea of there being Survivor fans who haven't seen this season. Everyone ever should watch it, *especially* fans of this series.** It is just *excellent.*

**Dabu's personal ranking:** 1/27. As of right now, I have it tied for #1 with Marquesas and Pearl Islands, but after a rewatch of all three, it will almost certainly eclipse them.

**Overall verdict:** If you haven't watched this, you're doing yourself a disservice - not just as a fan of Survivor but as a human being who watches television. So go! Watch it now! Right now! Not tomorrow; *today!*",46

That being said, this season is vastly, vastly different from all of the seasons that came after it; it's more naive, it's a lot less polished, and even Jeff doesn't really know what he's doing at first. So if you are watching this as your very first season, take it with a grain of salt. If you are watching it after other seasons, be prepared for something completely different. This season is more like a documentary than a game show, with only a small bit of strategy. If you like the character and survival aspects of survivor, this is the season for you.",2
1.0,Borneo,cy7l63z,"This is the OG season, so to not watch it at all seems sacrilegious.  But just a warning if you're into modern-day Survivor and haven't seen Borneo: it's not even close to the same game.  Voting strategies are individual decisions, the word 'alliance' is taboo, and only a few players really know what needs to be done to win the money.  

That said, this is the one that started it all.  Fifteen years ago, this was revolutionary, gripping television that captivated the world.  This is the framework for everything that came after it, so I'd definitely recommend watching it at least once.

I'm not sure how to rank this season fairly with the rest, because it's apples and oranges to me.  ",2
1.0,Borneo,cy6ldeb,"Personally, I recommend not only watching all seasons, but, if possible, trying to watch the original 8 seasons in order. Despite my personal feelings, however, the reality is that Borneo has mixed reviews when it comes to how it has held up over time. As the show's very first season, it is *very* different from where Survivor is now 15 years later. Given that they had never filmed or edited Survivor before, there is a rawness to this season as the show figures out how it wants to present itself--it definitely lacks the shiny, streamlined polish that the later seasons have. There is a lot of early installment weirdness present: Frequent explanations and monologues by Jeff Probst; alarmingly simplistic challenges; lots of cheesy early 00's synth music, etc. Yet the experimental nature of Borneo doesn't mean it's a sloppy season. Borneo is a labor of love from the people who made it and was an instrumental show when it came to changing the face of American television. 

Because the game of Survivor had never been played before Borneo, this season is an excellent explanation of the duality of Survivor, a game where you must weigh the needs of the group against the needs of the individual as each castaway seeks to both survive the elements *and* win the game. The story that unfolds as the ugly truth of this social experiment comes to light is a classic. However, for some viewers, this may be a drawback: as this is the first run, the focus on ""strategy"" that the later seasons are known for is significantly reduced. The counterbalance to this is that this season makes much more frequent usage of confessionals than the later ones do, which means you spend significantly more time with each castaway. Nobody in this cast is difficult to remember, and it is stocked with some big, memorable personalities. There is a player for every viewer to pull for in Borneo. 

For viewers who became hooked on the show due to a more recent season, I honestly don't know whether or not to recommend Borneo. I've seen as many people find it boring as I've seen people who find it brilliant. All I can suggest is that if you are new to the franchise, make this one of the first seasons you attempt. It's a keynote in Survivor history that, at the very least, is worth seeing just to say you've seen it.

1.0,Borneo,cy6y6vq,"I'd recommend watching this season first. But despite this season being having appeal out of being the original, it also has some really good storytelling and engaging characters.

1.0,Borneo,cy6mjyd,"Late entry Survivor fan. I love Borneo with a capital L, but I like it less as a season of Survivor, the game, and more of an island documentary, if that makes sense. It's got a radically different feel from everything after it, but I like it, and I love many of the characters.",6

There's no reason not to watch it if you haven't. All-time great characters, that hold up with time, and some people even think strategy is ""wrong"". The challenges and rewards were a bit rough, probably due to the budget, but that's not a big deal. 

Its definitely a top 10 season for me, could be top 5 depending on where some later seasons fall on my 30 season rewatch. ",5

Despite my less-than-favorable first seasons, I pretty quickly fell in love with Borneo, and then AO and Africa after it. There was something about how *different* it was from the seasons I had already seen that hooked me, and the way the season played out was interesting enough to keep me hooked, even if I already knew how everything played out. I wholeheartedly recommend Borneo.",5
1.0,Borneo,cy6lejy,"It had a really weird vibe in most episodes, like there wasn't really any structure to them. Challenges and stuff seemed at more random times than you see in today's game.

I will say, probably one of my favourite seasons in terms of characters/character development, and it's also one of the funnier seasons we've had. ",3

1.0,Borneo,cy8k67y,"As if happens, I'm 9 episodes in at the moment. A little background, my first seasons were 22,23,26,7,28,25. After Borneo, the earliest season I've seen is Amazon. So, I'm very new school. 

I love this season. It's one of my favourites. Having just finished Cambodia, I'm fucking sick of strategy, to be honest with you. I wanted cool people just hanging out and surviving and making jokes, and for this reason Borneo is utterly amazing and one of my favourite seasons.

P.S. My other favourites are Cooks, Micronesia, HvV, and Cagayan.

EDIT: Oh, and another reason Borneo is great for a new schooler like me: Jeff is so beautifully genuine and earnest in everything he says. Nowadays he says the same dozen catchphrases again and again, everything feels fake, trashy and impersonal. ",2

1.0,Borneo,cy6qppy,"I personally like Australia more than Borneo, I think the cast is more interesting and Australia has a little more polish. With that being said I do think it is the most important season of survivor and one that everyone should watch. For me it's middle tier",1
1.0,Borneo,cy8hcsk,"I started watching season 30 and 28 at the same time, and watched Borneo a couple seasons into my Survivor watch through. Its mind-blowing because of the entire lack of strategic thinking happening in the game as it starts. Its almost worth it just for the novelty of people playing the game terribly. Some of the characters are so engaging and fun that they drew me in, but honestly I didn't finish the season, because when those players started getting destroyed and no one was smart enough to figure out how to stop the inevitable from happening, it got incredibly boring. Still haven't watched the end cause I couldn't make it through.",1
1.0,Borneo,cyadq9d,"My first season was Cagayan. After that season I was hooked so I went back to watch all the old ones from the beginning. Honestly, I like Borneo but it's nowhere near my favorite. I liked seeing the roots of where the show started and I liked that it was more about characters and survival. It's interesting to see how almost amateur the show is in its early stages and how homemade everything looked. That said I also found it kinda boring and cheesy :x I'm just more entertained with newer seasons than I was with Borneo. I never got why everyone here loves it so much aside from nostalgia like you said. 

Tbh I'm glad that I started with a newer one and went back to see all the early seasons. I don't think I would've gotten hooked on the show the way I did if I had started with the beginning, but I am glad I went back to watch all the originals. It's fun to watch the game evolve into what we watch today. ",1

1.0,Borneo,cy6kngx,"I think I fit your descrption. I watched Marquesas-Palau as a kid, but there's very little I actually remember about it, so I went into it with an open mind. I just got back into Survivor this season.

All in all, I thought it was pretty solid. You can definitely tell that everyone was trying to figure out what exactly was going on, and the challenges are a lot more basic than what we're seeing now. You can also tell this was 15 years ago based both on the production quality (not like they can do anything about that), and some of the comments contestants made (mainly Rudy in that regard). But there were still a number of interesting characters and a story that ties everything together, so I'd recommend it.

Would I have somebody new start with Borneo? Probably not. I'd have them watch a more recent season that gets high praise (something like Philippines or Cagayan), but I would say to watch it at some point. Not for historical significance, but because it's just a damn good season.",1
1.0,Borneo,cy7swl9,"""...documentary turned game because of one certain castaway..."" is probably the best way to sum up S1. Tremendous fun to watch it, especially today, but for different reasons than a season like 28 or 31.",1

I have to say I agree. I've been watching live since the first episode... but I have not been able to go back and rewatch the early seasons. I'm fascinated that so many people here love rewatching Season 1, but to me it was like watching paint dry. Couldn't get into it at all. But if someone was starting from the very beginning and going in order, I'm sure that'd be more doable.",2
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6jyg7,"A seriously underrated season. The pre-merge is a solid B, but the post-merge is an A-Fucking-Plus.

The strategy and plot both become amazing. A whole bunch of huge characters make it past the merge and battle it out in an impressive back-and-forth game. 

And that Final Tribal Council . . . it's my favorite scene in all of Survivor. It so perfectly captures the characteristics of the incredibly strong F2, showcasing the strengths and weaknesses of both players. The jury is super emotional and pretty bitter. There are ample tears. One answer in particular — involving a race track — is my favorite Survivor moment, bar none. Even if it may have been total BS or possibly scripted by the F2 member, it still hits me directly in the feels every time.

This was the first season of Survivor I ever watched. And it got me addicted to the show, hook, line, and sinker. Vanuatu is that good. Watch it.",29
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6jjap,"My personal favorite season. The pre-merge is a bit slow and monotonous at times with some predictable if not boring boots, but the post merge is the best Survivor has to offer. 

Characters and strategy receive equal focus so nobody is too dramatic or too game-centric. Most of the mergers have great story arcs and character development, including the season's villain who's easily up there with the best of the best and doesn't get enough credit for their role. The final tribal council is amazing, one of the best ever. The comedy is top-notch, the funniest belonging to a man who may just be the best confessionalist the show's ever seen. 

Overall, gameplay is relatively advanced for the time and keeps you on your toes, but the season's relatable, genuine, and developed characters are its high point. ",9
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6yxau,"Currently my favorite season by a decent margin. Premerge is perfectly fine and has a decent storyline revolving two neurotic characters, but the postmerge is absolutely fantastic. Even in episodes where it's somewhat obvious what's happening, the dynamics and characters make it amazing still. It's truly telling that 5 people alone from this season are some of my all time favorites with two of them being top 10 for me. Also, the FTC is easily the best I've seen as far as speeches, comments, emotion, and payoff go. Vanuatu is incredible and I'm soooo happy it's reputation is picking up.",4
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6jt1k,YES YES YES YES YES! Vanuatu is amazing and it is criminal how low so many people rate it. IMO this season contains the best single season character arc in the history of Survivor,5
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6nnhl,"3rd place for me after S20 and S18. Vanuatu has possibly the best storyline ever, and one of the greatest tribes ever in my opinion. To me, this is the beginning of an evolution to what it is now. Everything is focused on, from the location, characters and strategy. I don't know who is a villain or a hero, they really are interchangeable, and that adds to the fun. Its definitely a fun season, with one main conflict storyline throughout. At the end, the FTC is incredibly emotional. Its a developed season with good strategy, all throughout.

9.0,Vanuatu,cy6ou60,"This season has it all. Emotion. Humor. Characters. Story. Editing. Gameplay. Drama. You name it, Vanuatu’s got it. And admittedly, it starts out slow, with lots of dead weight in the cast in the first few episodes. But there are enough great characters and fun little moments to keep you going, and there’s lots of good setup for later on. It really starts to pick up around the merge, the season’s climax is absolute perfection, and it only gets even BETTER as you get towards the end. Seriously, the final few contestants are easily my favorite set of endgamers of all time, and each of them has a very fulfilling arc from beginning to end. It plays out damn near perfectly, and the final tribal council is easily the best one we have ever seen. Oh, and there are volcanoes too! If you haven’t seen it, go watch it. It’s fucking awesome. 

Jacare’s rank: #2/31",3
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6sy2a,"Amazing season. One of the best, very close to being my favourite. A really interesting case study of very different personalities/characters from different walks of life which I found fascinating. Everyone who makes the merge is a strong character with three of four being among my all time favourites. They perfectly incorporated the traditions and culture of Vanuatu into this season making it feel unique. The challenges were good, with the final four immunity challenge in particular being a highlight. It has such a unique narrative and character study while also diving into the concepts of morality and trust quite a bit. Everyone, post-merge felt like a wholly rounded character and this was helped by the reasonably balanced editing. It feels like a very raw season and heck after writing this it might just be my favourite. Give Vanuatu a try and hopefully you can love it as much as I do.",3
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6yvwe,"Vanuatu is often a very, very popular season among those who have seen it, and its fans are very, very loyal - yet, I guess because it hasn't had a bunch of returning players or something, not many fans have seen it. I'm very surprised to look at polls and see how few /r/survivor users have seen this one.

I think it's a very, very good season, though, and definitely one that people should check out. It has some really colorful characters, it has some moments that are *super* unpredictable and satisfying, it has some incredibly complex characters. It has great moral struggles, it has great strategy, it has a bitchin' location complete with volcanoes. It has a great and entertaining winner. It has pretty much everything that you could ever want in a Survivor season. Very, very well-rounded season with a wide enough pool of characters that you'll almost certainly find someone to like. I don't really have a ton to say on it, particularly without spoiling some of its storylines, except that I think it is quite good at everything, I think it is a very strong addition to Survivor canon, and I think it is absolutely a season you should watch.

What I will say is that Vanuatu is best described as a ""slow burn"", and not just because ""burn"" creates a bit of a pun with all the volcanoes. If you start it and you're a few episodes in, and you're thinking ""This is okay, but.. why do people love it so much?"", don't worry. Most people don't love it for the first few episodes (though I do think the premiere is pretty great.) It builds and builds, it gets better as it goes, and everything that eventually happens is very much worth the setup. So when you watch Vanuatu, have faith and know that even if you aren't zomgcrazy about the beginning, that doesn't mean it won't turn out to be one of your favorites. A very strong season.

**My Personal Ranking**: 12/29, but upon a rewatch, I expect it to probably jump up to 10 or higher.

**Overall verdict**: Of the 9-16 era, I'd probably put Vanuatu second only to Palau as a ""must-watch"" one. It's a super impressive season that does just about everything right and just about nothing wrong, and while I wouldn't pick it right away for someone to watch, it's definitely one that you should watch fairly early in your Survivor viewing career and will probably really, really enjoy.",7

The pre merge had so many entertaining characters, and I actually enjoy the seasons that start with men vs women. The FTC was great and it has in my opinion one of the best winners ever.",4

9.0,Vanuatu,cy7kxql,"Super strong season.  Its premerge is nothing special (though it does have some awesome moments and it sets up characters really well) while its post-merge is in my top 5 stretches of episodes in all of Survivor.  Vanuatu is a season with an awesome boot order, with pretty much every character from merge onward being an A-tier Survivor character, with four in particular being A++ characters.  It is extremely compelling television that actually gets better on a rewatch IMO (though it is still fantastic on a first watch).  It's just a fantastic season overall and I'd recommend it to any Survivor fan.  I'd put this as borderline top 5, and I think Vanuatu-Palau is the best back-to-back season stretch in all of Survivor.",2

9.0,Vanuatu,cy6uabh,"Vanuatu is the 9th season of Survivor, and was the first season after Survivor: All-Stars, which makes it a sort of beginning for the ""next generation"" of Survivor. While the first 8 seasons directly impact each following season, Vanuatu gets to stand on its own a little more.

As far as storylines go, Vanuatu's is exceptional. The storyline of the season, and the unique lead characters who carry it are the biggest strengths of this season. The biggest complaint I often see of this season is that the early game moves slowly, so if you find yourself feeling that way, rest assured--the ending will have you enthralled and on the edge of your seat. The show also does a very good job at integrating culture and uniqueness into what could have easily been just another island. 

This season also features tribes divided by sex/gender.",2
9.0,Vanuatu,cy6z7bw,"Vanuatu starts out with same twist that Amazon did, and it manages to hit the nail on the head by having much better characters giving the season a stronger pulse.

But jesus was that post-merge PHENOMENAL. I didn't expect any of that to happen. I found myself yelling at the T.V., cheering, getting angry, etc... And damn, the final two and final tribal council was the cherry on top of this excellent season.

6.0,The Amazon,cy7scs1,"I posted most of this for last year's winner rankings, but here's my (v2.0) defense of Amazon:

**Overall Editing**

* It's pretty much the perfect balancing act of showing the survival aspect of the show plus the daily interactions between contestants (early Survivor), and the strategy portion of the show, which also got a boost during this season (later Survivor). Seasons like Africa and Australia did have a lot of strategy in the very subtle maneuvering post-merge, but it can be overshadowed by the brutality of the survival aspect. 

* Maybe an underrated quality, but the season was good at storytelling. It gave us clear confessionals about what people were doing and thinking at nearly all points in the game and why they were doing so, even without telegraphing the final outcome. (Why is [Alex](/spoiler) targeting [Deena](/spoiler)? Because she was scheming behind his back and getting too power-hungry. Why did [Rob](/spoiler) vote out [Christy](/spoiler)? Because he wanted to work with the girls as you can see at the beginning of the episode, and was afraid of drawing rocks. Why did [Matt](/spoiler) align with [Jenna](/spoiler) at the endgame? Because he realized that having a relationship with everyone was a good way to keep yourself in the game in case they win immunity.) We don't have to rely on secret scenes or exit interviews or Periscopes to understand the moves people made in the game, which you certainly couldn't say about Cambodia, and which I think people now appreciate more after viewing a season where blindsides were more important than overall storytelling. 

* The location is pretty unique in that it's a tropical rainforest and not an island. This allowed them to do new challenges that fit the theme (fishing, looking in the village, the meat-eating challenge) that, while often bizarre, still managed to be competitive and unique variations on themes that Survivor had already done. The challenges overall were average, with some (like the first challenge) being huge builds with close finishes, while others (like the shuffleboard) were duds reminiscent of early to mid Survivor.

* The teams were equal at each stage of the pre-merge. This is pretty important because not only do we see most everyone in the early episodes (something missing from seasons like Cambodia and SJDS), but it fits in well with the theme of the season - the women have their win that fits nicely with the storyline in episode 1, then the men come back and kill it in episode 4. 

**Characters**

* The people are cast and edited to be *interesting* - they're not boring gamebots that we learn nothing about, and they do a lot of human things that are missing from most later seasons now, and we get the impression they could be regular people that happen to be Type-A personalities in their own lives. It's not a season full of awful, spiteful people like Thailand, but they also don't sit around all day and pretend to be a ""good person"" like in Australia. They interacted with each other in hilarious and entertaining ways, which made for some good TV moments that sometimes get forgotten about (the fight between Joanne and Christy, the love triangle, fallout from the F7 tribal council, the entire ""chain"" sequence). 

* They had a new spin of personality types, especially for characters in the post-merge. There's the hot chick who was a know-it-all (Heidi), the grumpy old man (Roger) AND the nice old man (Butch), the older woman in a position of power (Deena), the first superfan, who was also genuinely charming (Rob), and the survivalist who was outcasted from his tribe (Matt). This altered many of the character archetypes and narratives that correspond to those archetypes that had been set up during the first five seasons - I'm sure some people might've expected Ryan to be Silas-like in how he played the game, but probably not [first voted out](/spoiler). Nobody expected the ""older"" woman in [Deena](/spoiler) to intentionally buddy up to Jenna and Heidi after the Mallrats + complete elimination of young people in Thailand. 

* Each person had one or more storylines based on how they interacted with multiple people due to showing the camp life - instead of like in Cambodia where some people were only shown to be friends when it suited the story, and were rarely shown talking to people outside their current alliance/voting bloc. Like I said before about being edited as a season instead of episode by episode, this means that we see everyone interact with everyone at different points instead of hiding relationships to cover up alliances. 

**Strategy** 

* The gameplay got a huge boost up from Amazon, but not just from one person. This season was the first one where there was a totally new alliance that was made and that stuck together at the swap, which was a huge change from the ""two original tribes face off at the merge, one Pagongs the other"" that had been going on.

* Unlike the Fall of the Rotu 4, which is the only similar example in the first six seasons, it didn't stop after the fulcrum had turned and just have a straight Pagonging the other way. We had three major shifts in alliances in three episodes, because the people didn't just fall in line with an alliance like they had in every other time before. And that strategy still holds up - seasons like Redemption Island, South Pacific, and One World remind us that flipping is still a difficult science and isn't done nearly as often as it should be, while seasons like Pearl Islands show how good it can get when that strategy is in place. 

* It was actually the originator of the voting blocs, despite what Fishbach claims. This was the first season where you can see an integral part of modern Survivor strategy; if you have close ties with people that others don't have (how [Rob](/spoiler) had with [Matt](/spoiler) and [Butch](/spoiler) for example) that allows you to break away from the established pecking order without alienating yourself, and flip as a group. 

**Negatives**

* Is the confessional count for one contestant very high? Of course, and it's not even close. This is definitely a negative, though it's mitigated somewhat by everyone has a strong screen presence (aside from some of the pre-mergers, who do fall victim to under-editing), which wouldn't happen in modern Survivor (the person would be ignored completely) and it's not so extreme that a contestant has an average confessional count below 1. 

* Is there a complete breakdown of the winner's edit? Yes, and this is many people's big problem with the season, that the winner was under-edited and given some very unflattering moments. It may be a combination of several factors, such as making [Christy](/spoiler) look good or the entire bootlist being leaked before the season was out, but it is certainly a secret to the viewers how much the winner was liked and respected compared to the runner-up. 

* Are plenty of comments made then now considered misogynistic, or at least kind of uncomfortable to watch, thirteen years after the season filmed? Yes they are! Unfortunately this is something that not only comes with a lot of early seasons (the ""fat naked fag calendar"" segment from Borneo, Brian and Clay's comments throughout Thailand, pretty much anything Fairplay said), but still happens, even if the contestant today would be killed on social media for it.

* Are some of the pre-merge characters duds? Sure. This is where Amazon takes a hit compared to seasons like Australia, Africa, and Marquesas which all had great pre-merge characters. 

**Overall**

Amazon is a fun season that is full of entertaining people, underrated moments, a huge boost in the strategy, and very good (with important one exception) storytelling. It has a good mix of old school and new school Survivor: a great cast and a solid use of the location theme (that is sometimes overshadowed by seasons like Palau, Pearl Islands, or China), as well as invigorated strategy and a lot of competition and solid players in the post-merge ",12
6.0,The Amazon,cy6j8yn,"I would not recommend this season to a new person. The ""Battle of the Sexes"" has not aged well. ",32
6.0,The Amazon,cy6oclq,"You may be able to tell from my username, but I am a huge fan of The Amazon and am surprised to see its reputation taking a hit so much recently. Yeah, some of the themes are a little outdated, and yeah, the editing isn’t the greatest. But I’d say it is an absolute goldmine of fun and entertainment, through and though. It manages to oscillate between fun and lighthearted to cutthroat and emotional within the span of a few minutes. It gives the origin to one of the Internet’s favorite players ever, and tons of other fantastic characters as well. Once you get past the merge, seemingly every player becomes a power-hungry jackass, and everyone starts acting like high school friends one day, turning around and stabbing each other in the back the next day. And this creates a very unique atmosphere that makes it so much more fun to watch than pretty much any other season. Also my pick for one of the funniest seasons, with countless hilarious scenes sprinkled throughout. While a lot of your opinion will be determined by how you feel about the season’s outcome, keep in mind that the winner did everything they had to do, did just about everything right and just about nothing wrong. Just a great collection of fun moments and characters that create tons of interesting television.

6.0,The Amazon,cy73gvx,"Amazon is a mixed bag. The battle of the sexes twist creates a focus on image that really does feel uncomfortable and sexist in 2015. But it's also got some really great characters and plenty of people I wish had returned by now. I think it ultimately is a funny season (mostly thanks to two characters, one as intentional comic relief and one whose humor is totally unintentional) and is entertaining, and there is a contestant who is ahead of his time from a strategy perspective and is undoubtedly Amazon's breakout star. The finish is definitely polarizing, which I think doesn't help Amazon's lasting power. It's fun as a throwback, but it definitely doesn't hold up as well nowadays.",3
6.0,The Amazon,cy7cl8o,"This season had more strategy than any season that preceded it. The location is interesting and actually varies from the beach theme that, while not as common back then, made up the two seasons before this one. I think that dividing the tribes by sex always brings out the worst in both sexes, though, so the initial tribes are a bit annoying. Definitely improves post merge.",3
6.0,The Amazon,cy6ypnc,"It's interesting to me that this sub has seemingly soured on Amazon in recent months. I'm not a fan of it myself, but I think it's something that would appeal to a lot of people here: it is a very groundbreaking season in context and probably the first season to have truly ""modern"" strategy. And the contestant at the center of that is one of the most popular ones on this subreddit. I feel like the average /r/survivor user would probably love Amazon.

I'm not crazy about it but it is typically a pretty popular one. It's fun, it's exciting, and it's especially unlike the first five seasons and enhanced by them. Definitely worth seeing at some point, probably early on in your viewing as a popular season that's critical to the show's development, even if it is not a personal favorite of mine.

I'm by no means a ""new"" person to survivor, but I hadn't seen all of the first few seasons of survivor until recently. What is great about the ""battle of the sexes"" early on in this season is to see how much survivor, people, and television editing has changed since this season aired in 2003. Sure, it isn't for everyone, but I don't think it is a reason to not watch this show. 

There are so many  other things that make this season great. The setting is great and a lot of the challenges really incorporate the setting into them. Things like fishing challangesand ""how much meat can you tear off the bone?"" are really interesting and unique to this season I feel. The cast is pretty strong and the boot order is good. I found the strategy in the season to not only be great, but well told. Yet, I feel like there were few people that got strange edits after I read more about this season after watching. ",2
6.0,The Amazon,cy6rluo,"My personal favorite season. This season is easily the most strategic of the pre-All Stars seasons, so if you want a taste of the shows roots while also getting your share of modern strategy, this is the season for you. 

Its cast is one of the best, despite having only two of its members return for a later season thus far. Few people are invisible, and almost everyone is tied into the story due to the way the game plays out in the merge.

This season's big twist was that it was a ""battle of the sexes"" in that it featured a tribe of only men vs. a tribe of only women. This twist was re-used in seasons 9 and 24.",2

6.0,The Amazon,cy7gp0l,"The men vs women twist they executed in Amazon was allright, although it did not turn out well on retrospect and kinda disappear once the merge hit and I have to say that Vanuatu did the twist better. I think it's has to do with the Amazon cast where you have imbalanced 6 young men and 2 old men on the men tribe, while the women tribe are somewhat balanced with 4 young women and 4 old women throw in a boot order where the entire half of old people booted pre-merge, and most young people are last long enough to made the merge (A merge tribe having 7 young people and 3 old people) and most of young people would intermingle and quickly get along which it dims the twist and quickly disappear on the merge.

But Amazon was mainly popular not because of the men vs women rivalry, it's because it introduce the dynamic fluid gameplay, and to the less extent (unpopular opinion) because it somewhat resemblance to high school life, and just made me refresh my memory about my tennege life.",2

VERY entertaining, some of my favorite characters so far that I've seen, and the first season with some serious strategy. The beginning is a little rough and cringy, but the justice that ensues is absolutely worth watching.

Despite being strategically empty for most of the game (with few exceptions), the cast is one of the best put together and pretty much no one comes out of the season unlikable.

Gabon is best described as a series of near misses.  It had a great locale that forced the production to come up with minimalistic challenges that JUST MISS really being Survivor challenges.  The cast is full of great characters but a lot of them seem to JUST MISS being fleshed out in the edit.  It's endgame is one of the best endgames but because the set up to it is pretty shallow it JUST MISSes having the impact of other seasons.",28

And there’s a reason it pulled me in so much; the season is absolutely hilarious. People describe it as a “trainwreck” season, and while I think that’s better used to describe Nicaragua than Gabon, it still summarizes a lot of the things that go down here. The cast is freaking amazing, and epitomizes the idea of coming from different walks of life better than just about any other one. One particular set of partners contains two people who could not be more different in their everyday lives, but they’re a great team here, and Gabon is full of that kind of stuff. There is a big twist midway thorough the season that some people don’t like, and ff you want a season with excellent strategy, you probably won’t be a fan. But as far as fun character moments go, it’s hard to do much better than this one.

17.0,Gabon,cy705bq,"A lot of the comments will call Gabon a ""trainwreck season"", and I think that that's sort of accurate but sort of not. It's accurate in that it has a pretty freaking great assortment of weird, weird contestants doing some weird and hilariously self-destructive things.

But it's not like those contestants are unlikable; it's not the Fiji kind of trainwreck. And it's not a trainwreck that's hard to follow with things changing all the time, so it isn't one you should be deterred from watching. I think it might be more accurately described as a **cartoon,** full of funny contestants hurting themselves in funny ways, than a trainwreck. And furthermore, the season's core narrative and winner are really, *really* satisfying for a first-time viewer. I think part of what makes Gabon great is that it works on two levels: you can pay attention to it deeply with more knowledge of the franchise and see how fucking weird some of its stuff is, or you can just watch it not knowing much about the show, find someone to root for, and be happy with how it ends.

But what really makes Gabon great is that the cast is just fucking **FUN** - and edited well. This cast is actually my third-favorite in Survivor history, after Borneo and Marquesas.. so basically, I think this season is actually totally on par with some of the earliest seasons in terms of how its story is told and how character-driven it is. It has a lot of new-school stuff in terms of twists, but I think it's at heart kind of an old-school season whose focus is really on the personalities and how they interact. There are SO many little character moments that I end up catching more I'd forgotten about or never noticed every single time I watch it, and I've seen it like 4 or 5 times by now.

In that sense, **I think that this season perfectly blends older and newer Survivor,** and **this** season is **definitely the one that I'd recommend to start with if you don't start with Borneo** (though of course it can't hurt to try Borneo first then move on to this one if you don't like it.) Again, suggesting that someone start out at a point in a show after 16 seasons and nearly a decade of television feels pretty strange... but this season honestly doesn't feel altogether like modern Survivor, and I think it's very much at home within the original 7 - while containing some elements of the newer seasons, making it an excellent gateway.

So yeah, if you're not going to start at Borneo? I'd say definitely definitely definitely start here; China's also a good choice, but I think this one is better. If you actively want really strong strategic players, China would be a better starting point of the two, but if that's not a huge priority, then start here over China. This season is super, super easy to watch and enjoy, it's incredibly fun - but not in a Micronesia way where it's just all shocking twists; it's driven by its super fun, colorful, *diverse* collection of characters ranging from a pro Smash Bros player to an Olympic athlete to an emotionally unstable pin-up model to a guy who films weddings but hates marriage and is pretty much human Grumpy Cat. Maybe the most accessible and fun out of all 30 seasons Survivor has had, and stands the test of time even on multiple rewatches.

**Dabu's Personal Ranking:** 6/29

**Overall verdict:** Again, it's probably the most accessible and fun season, due to having some more modern elements while also being driven by a diverse collection of utterly brilliant characters. A really, really good starting point if you're not inclined to start at the original. The absolute highlight of modern Survivor.",5

*Tier: Top*

----

**Cast:** The cast has such an eccentric, eclectic mixture of people. It's not all hits, but some FANTASTIC characters come from this cast, some of my favorite players of all time in fact. Gabon's casting was unique, the players who made dents in the game are the type that don't normally create waves in a typical season. There's nothing typical about Gabon.

**Twists**: Returning to Africa, with no beaches or water challenges. Exile Island, with a hidden idol. Two swaps! A false merge feast. All of these factors created odd ripples in the game that will probably never be mirrored in any survivor ever. Good twists, leading to some very memorable moments.

**Shining Light:** The characters. The odd people, who do odd things, and never cease to amaze you with their new quirks and quotes. Characters who seem too insane to be real, and yet ring true to life as well. It's like a comedy at times, a true rib-tickler.

**You Should Watch If:** You've seen every other season and need more survivor. You are a huge fan of the returning players (even then it's iffy). You are a sadomasochist. You want to prepare for watching Caramoan. You often disagree with the majority's opinions on survivor. You are forced at gun point.

**One Word:** Silly

**Final Words:** This was my first season, and one I still hold near and dear to my heart. It is funny, impossible to predict, insane to watch play out, unique in so many fashions, and fun every second of the way through. You might not enjoy it like I do, but if you're anything like me you'll find the charm of it impossible to match.

The pre merge is amazing and a few characters take the spotlight with amazing one-liners. There is very little strategic gameplay which could be a turnoff for some people.

17.0,Gabon,cy6ypjg,"Gabon is a divisive season. I am in the camp who adores it, but there are a lot of people who aren't fans. It's obviously hard to really unpack the reasons why without spoiling what happens, but I'll try my best. The biggest ""hit-or-miss"" quality of this season is that drama and comedy come first and foremost, taking center stage over hardcore, cerebral strategizing and subtle, nuanced storytelling. Note that just because ""strategy"" isn't the focus doesn't mean that this game is predictable! This season is patently wacky and is carried by some really weird characters, many of whom are truly unique entries into the stable of Survivor castaways. There are a few contestants in particular who you'll probably find you alternate between loving to love and loving to hate. 

The location is also *breathtaking.* If you're unfamiliar with the West African nation of Gabon, the season's subtitle of *Earth's Last Eden* says it all. With huge green carpeted hills bursting from an lush oceanside jungle, the show couldn't have picked a better time to go HD. The castaways have a number of memorable encounters with animals during this season.

The fireworks fly both before and after the merge, with some of the most memorable moments, conflicts and strategic decisions ever made. Personally, I like it way less than most people; I’m not a big fan of the boot order on either side, a lot of the people I was most excited to see back are underedited, and I find the player who gets the most airtime to be absolutely insufferable. But there’s enough going on around that player to enjoy the season as a whole, and even as someone who likes it less than just about everyone, I’d still say it has countless fun stuff going on from beginning to end.

I honestly can't think of any reason this would be below Cambodia besides recency and would love to hear from someone that upvoted Cambodia but did not upvote HvV, I respect other people's opinions as best I can but I'm struggling to even play devil's advocate against myself here.  What problems does HvV have that Cambodia doesn't?  A few people do get underedited, but at least they aren't people that abruptly become incredibly important--the problem is certainly worse in Cambodia.  What pros does Cambodia have that HvV doesn't?  Cambodia has some big strategy and big Tribal Councils, but to say that HvV *doesn't* would be laughable.

Of the three All-Star seasons of Survivor this is, to me, *unquestionably* the best of them.  ",17

**Wilbur's Ranking:** 16/31",1
20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",cy70s8g,"**MAJOR RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!**

Fun season that I rank relatively high. I don't revere it as the awesome godly standout some people do, but I still think it's really fun, so I rank it pretty high.

**BUT!:** The things that I rank it high for are largely the continuations of previous seasons' storylines. This season just will not be nearly as enjoyable if you haven't seen previous seasons to know who these contestants actually are. The best parts of this season are *specifically* where it follows the journeys of its contestants from their previous appearances.

To fully familiarize yourself with this cast, I think you need to watch seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (1/3 aren't represented here, but they definitely are *majorly* represented in S8 All-Stars, which is a must-view before this one), 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. If you don't, you'll be missing out on a lot of stuff this season AND getting spoiled on those past seasons' outcomes.

And I don't think it's some utterly fantastic orgasmic viewing you should rush into anyway. I think that it's a very fun and satisfying season but that there are more fun and satisfying ones.

**My Personal Ranking:** 10/29, but I could see it dropping a couple places after rewatches of other seasons, and 10-12 are all pretty close.

**Overall verdict:** Solid, entertaining Survivor, but because *all of its cast are returning players* and those previous reputations and relationships do play MAJORLY into the dynamics and stories of this season, you shouldn't watch it early at all. You will get less out of it while also getting strongly spoiled on a bunch of previous seasons at once.",3

20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",cygbsen,"NOT your first season, but definitely a watch. Again, cross season references and storylines makes this not suitable to be a first season introduction.

while pre-merge is good with some great plays and blindsides, the post-merge was beyond anything we've seen these days. It focus on a few characters significantly, and it's easy to hate this season because you dislike this villain (especially that this person was considered to be notorious and make survivor history) and that this person stirred most of the drama. However, the rest of the group also contains significant amount of character and play, which you should not neglect as well. 

without going into the specifics, one person's move at the tribal council is still consider to be groundbreaking. On the other hand, another person's move (that caused the above situation and play to be possible) is just......plainly hilarious, ill-thought and funny. In fact, many of the characters are consider to be some of the best cast that's ever played survivor. 

The winner tells a great story at the FTC that (I felt) cause the win, but still an satisfying end and great season overall. ",1

I'm a fan of Africa.",23
3.0,Africa,cy6o2u5,"In my opinion, the single greatest classic season after Pearl Islands.

Africa doesn't even feel like the same show. The people are starving, baking, dying in the African heat, and it is brutal. In modern Survivor, you usually don't have to get water from a source. You usually don't have to put a mosquito net over your sleeping quarters. You usually don't have to put a freaking barbed wire circle around a forty foot radius point in your camp to prevent the lions from eating *you.*

Many people say Survivor is slightly enjoyable when playing. I doubt anyone was having fun out there.",8
3.0,Africa,cy6o7g4,"This is easily my second favorite season next to Tocantins. If you enjoy watching the survival aspects of the older seasons than Africa is the one to watch. I absolutely loved how unique it felt with them being in the middle of Africa. It can get tiring seeing them in a random jungle with a beach every single season, but seeing them stranded in the middle of Africa surrounded by Lions, and Elephants and Buffallo was really awesome.

I also think it has one of the better casts. Both the post and pre merge had amazing characters and I think it had one of the better pre merges. One of the alliances in the premerge is just terrible and seeing their downfall is incredible.",6
3.0,Africa,cy6j6aw,"One of the most underrated seasons imo. The Survivor boom was just starting to die down during Africa, and so this season isn't nearly as well known as Australia or Borneo, despite it being just as good.",16
3.0,Africa,cy6y7o1,"It's often said that in the earliest seasons of Survivor, the location itself was the ""17th player"" or ""17th character."" Nowhere is this truer than season three. Kenya is utterly without question my pick for the best location ever. It's so starkly different from anywhere else they've ever gone that every single second of this season just feels so different than any other one - and it's a positive difference, because it's so fucking stunning and gorgeous. They're actually out there in the middle of the savanna, which is astounding. It really drives home, with every single shot, that these are 16 Americans just dropped off into some other pocket of the world they'd probably never, ever see otherwise, and it's astounding. This comes into play in some of the challenges and rewards in ways that are nothing short of beautiful. **If anything can make you appreciate the environmental, survival side of Survivor (besides Australia's aptly titled ""No Longer Just A Game"" episode), it's the entirety of this season.**

Aside from all of that, you have some **incredible and colorful characters here**; this may be in my top 5 or so favorite Survivor casts. There are a variety of contestants you may love, love to hate, laugh at, and laugh with. Comic relief, heroes, villains, this season's got a very strong range of characters. It has a couple of the most iconic pre-merge boots ever, it has one of the most respected winners ever, and many characters in between are among the most popular, most unique, and most entertaining the show has ever seen.

And, oh yeah, it has one of the most shocking and unprecedented Survivor moments ever a few episodes in (which, of course, does benefit massively from having seen seasons one and two.)

Above all else, it's just **an entertaining viewing experience.** I just love this season in a way that's hard for me to really put into words, which isn't really a problem I often have. I think it's just that I utterly adore the location and generally love the cast - I dunno, I just feel excellent watching it. You've got awesome contestants here saying and doing awesome things in an awesome setting, making for an awesome product that I'm very happy is a part of Survivor canon and highly recommend to any and every Survivor fan.

If you're going to dive into old-school Survivor, I of course recommend Borneo first, but this is a *great* early season. I also think it is a big improvement over Australia, not just because it relies less on context and outside information, but also because it improves upon basically everything about Australia: it has almost as strong of a focus on the wilderness and a personal, emotional development of the contestants, but they also have a bit more color and ""character"" to them with a more dynamic game, more interpersonal drama, and more twists. If you want sort of an abridged chronological experience - if you're going to start at Borneo then go forward to trace the development without necessarily watching *EVERY SINGLE THING EVER* - I think **Africa could possibly be a better follow-up to Borneo than Australia is.**

**My Personal Ranking:** 4/29

**Overall Verdict:** This is a really fun, feel-good collection of episodes that'll leave you really satisfied. I really don't think there's much to complain about here, if anything. It's just good times. If you spend your time watching it, you certainly will not regret it, and you'll almost definitely come out of it with a few new favorite contestants. It also may be a better follow-up to S1 than S2 is if you're interested in the show's development/phases but don't have the time for every single thing, because it is basically an improved version of Australia in every way. Or if you're watching in a sort of haphazard order without caring about chronology, I'd definitely prioritize this one early as a hidden gem of early Survivor with some fantastic characters.",12

31.0,Cambodia,cy71dsq,"This is a top five season to me and is truly the first time I think an ENTIRE cast has come playing to win. Epic strategy, satisfying character arcs, and some of the best tribal councils ever. I really like the new twists the producers added for this season as well. It's been a while since I've been hooked so heavily on a Survivor season as I was with Cambodia. The only noticeable flaw to me was uneven editing, but the characters they featured more heavily were so fun to watch that I didn't really mind.

That being said, this season is HUGELY reliant on existing character arcs, and if past season spoilers are something that matters to you, DON'T WATCH THIS FIRST. All of the cast members are second-time players, none of whom won and three of whom placed 2nd in their original season. They also spoil the results of a few past seasons, most notably Borneo (S1), Tocantins (S18), and Cagayan (S28). But since this season's theme is Second Chances, there's a lot of storylines that involve past character arcs, and while Cambodia can still be fun to watch without already knowing the castaways, there are some story arcs that HEAVILY rely on past seasons.

**Required viewing for Cambodia:**

S18: Tocantins

S25: Philippines

S28: Cagayan

S29: San Juan del Sur

**Recommended viewing for Cambodia:**

S1: Borneo

S2: The Australian Outback (even just through the merge episode)

S27: Blood vs. Water

S30: Worlds Apart

S12: Panama

S15: China

S19: Samoa

Of course, to get the most out of any returnee season, I strongly recommend watching ALL of the aforementioned seasons. However, if you're going to pick and choose, this is what I recommend.",20
31.0,Cambodia,cy6kobv,"tl;dr middle-ish season, because certain aspects are quite good but the edit really is that bad--I posted this in another thread recently, sorry to those that have already seen it.  Hope it's sufficiently vague.

Now, it's still wayyy too close to the season to say anything fair about it and I would personally recommend the season be excluded from the rankings but I'm guessing that is not going to happen.

Pros:  
+Lots of strategy, for the strategy-minded person, and a lot of it is pretty good stuff  
+Just about every cast member really wants to be there and it shows, and the cast is good in general  
+A couple of massive blindsides and a couple of literally unprecedented Tribal Council results  
+Swaps keep everyone on their toes and help to shut down pregame alliances, and come the merge it's very much unclear who is going to side with who and when  
+Certain other twists and ideas were cool  
+Some harsh weather serves to remind everyone that yes, they're still having to actually survive out there, and no, it isn't always easy  
+Satisfying winner, relatively speaking  

Cons related to the edit:  
-Certain characters get shafted just about as bad as we've ever seen anyone get shafted, which especially hurts on an All-Star season. This makes them seem useless to the overall narrative, but it's then confusing when they suddenly appear. Characters that the viewers have perceived as not really playing the game are suddenly presented as major social or strategic threats. This consistently makes it obvious who is in trouble and also forces us to question everything we've seen up to that point.  
-Certain characters get overedited to alarming extremes. It's very easy to identify multiple probable late-game contestants and winner candidates, and one character in particular gets an overwhelmingly needless amount of airtime devoted to repeating themselves endlessly.  
-Related to both the above, but also more: many characters get completely misrepresented from how they were playing or how they were perceived on the island. Based on what has come out in post-interviews, ""What You Didn't See,"" etc., this is one of the least truthful edits in Survivor history. One finalist was apparently perceived by several players as more than a little nuts and we didn't see any of that--me telling you this reveals absolutely nothing and is not a spoiler in any way, because you just plain won't know who I'm talking about, that's how much they *hid* about this person. At least one underedited character was apparently a big threat to win and we didn't see any of that. One character was presented to us as having a great idea of how to try to subvert their own boot and we all gave this person praise for it... until it came out that this wasn't actually their idea at all and they had a much worse idea and execution, and this was the same person who accidentally ruined an earlier plan and we didn't see that either. And there's more like this. What was presented to us was often very misleading and even outright false. That detracts massively from my personal enjoyment of the show.  
-Storylines are raised and dropped at the drop of a hat. Characters presented as major rivals don't really have a resolution to their conflict. Players discuss the possibility of a specific alliance and this discussion is given heavy focus, but that possible alliance not only fails to come to fruition but isn't even really mentioned again. Etc. etc. This is something that I think will become even more apparent on a rewatch.  
-Soooo much airtime is devoted to strategy, and specifically to the strategies of a handful of specific players. There are some great character moments, particularly near the end as one particular person finally starts getting the airtime they deserve, but in general they're simply spread too thin.  
-The finale is quite, quite rushed  
-Man I feel like I had even more but I'll stop here  

Cons not related to the edit:  
-The challenges in this season had a couple big highlights but were otherwise some of the weakest in the history of the show. I'm not terribly interested in challenges nowadays regardless but it got downright frustrating  
-Half a dozen people get spectacularly screwed by an early twist and it leaves a sour taste  
-The players and host insist that they are revolutionizing the game when the basic shifts we see here are not unique or new in any particular way, and it gets grating  

I would describe this season as one of big highs and big lows. Some of the pros are big pros and some of the cons are big cons. Some of the season's biggest moments were very exciting, there were some great character moments and spots of humor and survivalism and so on, and certain individual episodes were especially good, but I suspect that this won't be a great rewatch even though some of the big moments had a lot of impact the first go-around. Middle-of-the-roadish.  

I strongly encourage everyone that is currently in love with this season to think about whether they're just focused on a couple big plays; I strongly encourage everyone that currently detests this season to think about some of the great character moments and storylines that *do* actually happen or come to fruition.

This is, of course, not a good season to start with by any stretch of the imagination, given that it has at least minor spoilers for like 11 other seasons and pretty dang massive spoilers for several of them.",30

But I was one who really liked the finale, appreciated the story they were telling with a character who seemed massively over edited and a lot of the nonsensical stuff started to gel into the winners overall storyline.

And the edit was fine. Even the parts I didn't like seemed like the players who were causing it.",4
31.0,Cambodia,cy723rk,"I think it's an incredibly mediocre season with horrible storytelling that gave us one of the all-time worst Survivor casts because their edits were too often erratic or non-existent and the biggest characters were bland gamebots. If you watch *purely* for ""strategy"" it is good, but outside of like two or three contestants in the entire cast, there is literally nothing else here. Major letdown for me after all the pre-season hype.

But even aside from all that it's not something you should start with because it's full of returning players with constant, *constant* references to their past games. The entire season is a sequel to a bunch of other seasons. Don't start here.

**My Personal Ranking:** 20/29 and it should probably be lower.

31.0,Cambodia,cy6vwfw,"For me there are two main reasons why Cambodia isn't a top-tier season:

31.0,Cambodia,cy7etbb,"After the awful mess that was season 30, this season is a much-needed return to form for Survivor. The cast is probably the most likable of all time, thanks in part to the fact that they were voted in by fans. The only real flaw I can think of for this season is the edit, which is too focused on some characters and doesn't give any time at all to others.

Besides that, though, this is one of the best. It has every element of Survivor working for it, some of which had been missing for a long time: There are interesting characters, intense strategies, crazy tribal councils, drama and feuds, incredibly rough survival conditions, moments of humor, and for the first season in a while, uses of the culture of the filming location. The premerge is interesting enough, with one tribe being a clusterfuck of strategy and drama, another being more like a family, and another having to overcome great odds. The postmerge is unlike any other, with a new form of survivor strategy that could be a sign of things to come or a result of some of the twists of the season. Regardless, the postmerge will keep you on your toes and excite you, before lulling a bit with a lackluster finale.

Is it the best season of survivor? No. But it is a hell of a ride, and might just be one of the top five. ",3

31.0,Cambodia,cy6oile,"Just finished up a few days ago so it’s still pretty fresh in people’s minds, so I predict it could rank higher than it would a few months from now. But still, don’t make this anything close to the first season you watch. It relies on you knowing previous players and their storylines, because you’re not going to learn much about them here. Possibly the most strategy-heavy season of all time, with constant talks of evolution of the game and of strategy without us really seeing anything all that new. If you’re watching for pure entertainment and don’t care all that much about a flowing story or consistent characters, it’s a decent choice I suppose, but I’m personally not a fan after the first few episodes. Whatever you do, just don’t make it your first season.

The problem with this is that as the players make a move, we have no idea why this move is a good idea, whether or not it will actually work, or why the people involved are even talking to each other.

The character's are good (I mean, we chose them) but there are many moments when we are left scratching our heads wondering ""I know how it happened, but I don't know why it happened""

The Survivors and producers break the 4th wall and reference the show a lot, which, at times, just feels like Probst and co patting themselves on the back. It doesn't take anything away from the season, its just constantly coming up.",3

31.0,Cambodia,cy7b2hc,"For a season that I was so hyped about in the off-season, I was very disappointed with the final product.

I liked most of the pre-merge. But other than that, there was nothing else to the season other than a bunch of boring gamebots and alpha males talking about idols, blindsides, and big moves. I know talking strategy is a part of the show, but it would have been nice to see more substance than just the typical strategy talk that took up 95% of the episodes. Because of this, I really couldn't get invested in the cast and what was happening around them.

The challenges were lame and uninteresting.

The editing sucked. Some contestants were pushed to the side, while the majority of the airtime is given to 2-3 characters. It's like what was the point in making the public vote for the players if you aren't even going to show most of them?

And of course the bad editing had a major effect on the storytelling. Some story lines came and vanished out of nowhere. And there's also one major story shoved down our throats only to find out that it was completely false and pointless in the end. And to think all that airtime for that story could have been given to characters that were barely shown!

Simply put, it contains many cross-season references. 

That being said, this season would be more entertaining for those that have watch some survivor before. With that in mind, you would understand how crazy the post-merge and the reason why many people cite this seasons as the one where many was genuinely playing to win. 

The only thing that you should bare in mind is that many of the characters are either under-edited or over-edited that we didn't get to see much of them, some were nearly invisible even till they're gone. In the case of one specific character, that's too much that we don't need. while there are some adorable characters and none of the cast are villainy or despicable, That's more likely to disappoint you rather then impress.",1

31.0,Cambodia,cy6l9pb,"Let's see if I can get the spoiler tags right:

[Perceived as nuts:  Tasha.  People outside her alliance didn't just dislike her, they couldn't stand her, and they also thought she was an oddball.  Joe reports that she was ""crazy."" (his words) Kimmi says that at the food challenge she was saying things like ""I'm doing this out of hate!"" Keith made a point of saying he would vote for Abi over her in a post-interview.  I forget who, but someone at some point confirmed that--like in Cagayan, which we didn't see on TV in that season either--she said a weird thing or two about how God had chosen her to win Survivor.  She accused Kass of racist comments when as far as I know Kass has never been accused of anything of the sort by anyone else, and given that she previously accused Tony of sexism over comments that are confirmed to have been directed at the women currently on the tribe and not all women everywhere forever by other castaways, it seems pretty likely that Tasha misinterpreted something innocuous and went ballistic over it.](/spoiler)

[Threats to win if they made it deep--Kimmi, Wigs, and even Keith. The show is pushing the big moves narrative too hard.  All of those players were either edited as absent or bumblers and every single one of them would have stood a good chance against Spencer and would have destroyed Tasha easily.  It seems unlikely that any of them could beat Jeremy or Kelley but against anyone else any of those three players would have had a chance to win.  That is never really apparent in the show except when suddenly it has to be and they get booted.](/spoiler)

[Person that got their mistakes completely wiped out of the show:  It's Joe's fault Savage went home.  Joe leaked the info to Ciera that Wentworth was the target and Ciera let Wentworth know.  He had absolutely zero strategic reason for doing this and as a consequence his greatest defender went home.  And then later, at his own boot... the show told us his plan was to try to target Abi, playing off fears of a women's alliance and her completely free Final 3 seat if she stayed.  Fine.  Not a bad idea.  Except no, we know now that Joe was trying to play both sides really hard and somehow create a tie between Abi and Tasha and get Tasha sent home on the revote.  This is why Keith voted for Tasha--no one told him that they weren't following through with Joe's idiotic mess of a plan because they didn't want him to tell Joe in case Joe *did* have an Idol but felt confident he didn't need it.  Everyone knew Joe was running around trying to set up this ludicrous switcharoo.  In addition, we saw hints of people's disrespect for him in the show (the witches rolling their eyes at him, Spencer dumbing things down for him, etc.) but it has become clear now that Joe, though liked in general, was significantly less widely believed and thought-highly-of than we were led to believe.](/spoiler)

[Oh, also, I should mention:  Spencer making a big deal about his improved social connections and whatnot, over and over and OVERRRRRRR, and then getting blasted 10-0-0 in the finals without us getting to actually see almost any of the evidence that the people out there weren't really feeling the love until the finale.  We were kind of *forced* to assume that Spencer was in a good position jury-wise against anyone but Jeremy because we saw lots of content telling us he was and no real evidence to the contrary, but that simply wasn't true.](/spoiler)",16

16.0,Micronesia,cy6paw8,"Honestly, I think this season is overrated. It suffers from all the same problems that made Caramoan one of the worst seasons ever (unbalanced fan and fav casting, production interference, questionable twists, poor editing, and a general sense that this is manufactured Survivor) except to a MUCH lesser degree. 

Of course, this cast is miles ahead of Caramoan's, which is why this season is still well-regarded. Still, I just can't help but be completely unsatisfied by the storylines and especially the winner; Their victory just feels tainted to me after all the rumors and strange production choices. Fans vs Favorites seasons seem to come with a producer narrative that they're desperate to shove down our throats, even if the viewer isn't ready to believe anyway.

16.0,Micronesia,cy741vu,"You'll see a lot of comments here about ""All sizzle, no steak"" and while it is certainly true it lacks the deep character story lines of some seasons I still think it has a lot of great, rich moments, from probably the best edit for a quitter ever to (IMO) one the most gut-wrenchingly sad tribals ever (the last TC pre-merge), and while the dominant alliance isn't totally loved around here some of their endgame confessionals are some of my favorites in the whole series because of one big reason: they really seem to be having fun with it. 

And that's what I really like about this season: Much more than the other FvF and much MUCH more compared to most newbie seasons almost EVERYONE was having fun and playing to win in Micronesia. The Favorites were true favorites who probably thought that was their last chance (little did they know HvV was only two years away) and the Fans were actually fans who appreciated the game. There weren't a bunch of mactors out there, or D-list celebrities who had never heard of the show but want a resume booster, or stunt-casting of child actors or sport players. It reminds me of one of the better parts of Cambodia in this sense. Just how during season 31, after the first idol play, the cast was freaked out but they were also smiling and laughing and clapping because they knew and respected the game and they understood how awesome of TV that would be later. I think you can see that same amount of respect for the game and ability to have fun with it in Micronesia. 

Obviously it has it's weak moments, a couple of dud fans, a few favorites that we don't really get to see enough, but overall I don't think it should be discounted as much as it is.  I think a lot of the commentators on these posts seem to think everyone watches survivor with their phone on silent, all the lights dimmed, with a pen and paper to keep track of any subtle character storylines. But sometimes you just want to smoke a bowl, drink a couple of beers and throw some Survivor on the TV to watch while you surf the web. And I think Micronesia is a great season for that type of thing. If you're looking to write your PhD dissertation on Survivor, look elsewhere, but if you can just appreciate a fun, fairly unpredictable season for what it is you'll enjoy it.",11

16.0,Micronesia,cy7e3c9,"I've heard a lot of debate over where modern Survivor starts.  To me this is the first modern season, for better or for worse.  I'll go into both:

For better:  Micronesia is probably the most strategically sound season up of its time and has some great moves that people are still studying 15 seasons later.  It also has a ton of fun moments relating to that strategy.  This season is particularly amazing on a first watch, when all the moves are fresh.

For worse:  The focus on strategy leads to a lack of focus on character development, leading most characters to become caricatures, gamebots, or seriously underedited.  This is particularly disappointing in the case of a few returnees.  The winner of this season has a really neutral winner's edit, and I'd say their win started the modern trend of having winners be edited in a way to piss nobody off.  I mentioned how this season is particularly great on a first watch, but all the things that make it great on a first watch lead it to be very bland on a rewatch.

16.0,Micronesia,cykbej7,"I'm not even convinced that this season is real. I just finished watching it and I'm kind of left speechless, not in a good way, but not in a bad one either. It honestly felt like a fanfiction fever-dream parody of survivor that I imagined instead of an actual season, and I'm not even sure I can really explain why. The players in this season, as well as Jeff at times, just acted more like caricatures of themselves rather than what they acted like on their first season or what you'd expect them to act like.

Aside from that, it's a pretty good season. If you're going to watch it, I'd suggest doing it before the later seasons because a large part of it is the shocking/surprising moments and those feel watered down after having viewed later, more shocking seasons. The editing is pretty uneven here, which is frustrating because people acknowledge that with other seasons but I haven't seen it so much with this one. The other problem I had with it was just how it played out--at times it felt like watching a popular high school clique dominate the more likable unpopular crowd.

It's an incredibly fast paced and easy to binge on, so if you're looking to see some of your favorite players from 9 and 12-15 play again, you want to see some big moves, and you don't want to invest to much in a season, this one is the one to watch.

16.0,Micronesia,cy6kox1,Still my favorite post merge ever,3
16.0,Micronesia,cy7lstr,"I'm surprised this is so low, considering it has been at the top of this list for a long time now. For me, it's definitely in my top 3, but I've only seen about 12 seasons or so. I think the pre-merge is an excellent representation of how not to play Survivor. There is one character in particular who makes it further than they would have in any other season of Survivor with any other cast of players. That being said, there's still some gold in there. The post-merge, as it has been stated, is absolutely excellent. That is if you're looking for blindsides, blunders, and bone-headed decisions. One of the most shocking and dumbest moves in Survivor history happens on this season and you need to watch the whole season to really get the full effect from it.

As far as casting goes, I think they did a good job on the Favorites. Unlike Caramoan, where they picked productions favorites, the people in this season are actually people that fans wanted to see. And while their opposition isn't necessarily the bees knees of Survivor, they all at least seem to know more about Survivor than the fans in S26. But there are still some qualms that I understand with this group of fans. Arguably only half, maybe less, are actual fans of the show. Plus, this twist is basically production's way of making sure they get a returning player the victory. It's an extremely unfair twist that I low key hope never gets brought back. 

Some of the moments in challenges this season are great. Of the seasons I've seen, this has gotta be my favorite as far as challenges go. I'm not gonna lie, it's been a while since I've watched this so I'm a little hazy. But of the challenges I do remember, I was actually invested in them, which I can't say about early or modern day Survivor. 

As I've typed this up, my opinion of the season has gone down a little bit, but I still don't think it should be this low. Don't start with this season, but certainly don't save this season for last. It's good enough to where you have to watch it ASAP. But of course watch seasons 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 15 first. ",1

I need to rewatch Micronesia to know whether I personally like it or not - but I do think I still generally understand its merit as a Survivor season from a more objective standpoint. It's a fun, exciting, more ostensibly ""strategic"" season and, for better or for worse, a gateway into some of the more modern seasons, and it's often considered to be especially exciting the first time that you watch it - but this comes somewhat at the expense of complex storytelling, with not much going on besides the surprise factor. I've seen it compared to ""Survivor candy"": It's yummy and easy to like but doesn't really leave you with anything.

I'm not sure how I feel on it or how much I agree with those criticisms because I need to rewatch it - but I **definitely** think that this should not be where you start, or close to it. It misrepresents the franchise and is an anomaly in how excitement-oriented it is, even compared to many of the seasons that came after it. And, of course, half of the cast are returning players whom you should watch in their original seasons first. Fun season, worth watching, but horrible introduction to the series.

The problem is, most of the fun and drama I was describing gets sucked out of it later on, and while I do like pretty much everyone in the endgame as individuals, as a whole they aren’t a very interesting group. Definitely a season you have to watch as one of the most important ones of all time — 45 million people watched the first episode, and it got to lead out the Super Bowl — but I think it’s one of the few seasons that is significantly more interesting early on than later on, and the lack of forward momentum drags it down a lot.

Outback",cy7c7qv,"My personal favorite season of Survivor. I think around half of the cast has returned in later seasons, and for good reason: this is a season filled with very likable, relatable characters. While some seasons might have a cast filled with bizarre and quirky characters, this one was one with all applicants, meaning the characters are closer to ""average"" people, while still being entertaining. 

The survival aspect of this season is perhaps one of the strongest in the series. Especially towards the end of the season, the conditions become brutal. There still isn't much strategy here, but there's a notable improvement from the first season.",4
2.0,"Australian
Outback",cy6xvi2,"The thing about Australia is that this is the most ""old-school"" of all old-school seasons, even more than the first one. So if you are looking for constant blindsides and shifting week-to-week twists, this is not the season of Survivor for you. Now, that isn't a weakness - but if you're a new viewer who wants to know **""What season is just like Cambodia?"", the answer is pretty much ""Not Australia.""** And if you have watched mostly recent seasons but want to watch some old-school ones, I don't think I'd recommend this one first, despite the large number of eventual returning players, because if it *is* the first/only one you've seen from that era, I think it'll misrepresent the era as ""slower"" than it actually is.

But it still a very great television product - not just borderline required viewing for any serious Survivor fan who is at all interested in the history of the show, but also a strong enough collection of episodes and characters that there is a *reason* it is so important other than arbitrarily being the second one. Survivor 2 had to be really, *really* good television to prove that the original wasn't just a gimmicky fluke, and it definitely lived up to what the franchise needed. Being as old-school as old-school gets isn't a weakness: The **nature and survivalism** are stronger here than pretty much anywhere else, giving us some incredibly dramatic and compelling scenes that really drive home **how much more goes on besides just ""the game.""** This season might not be the most popular among some fans who really love the fast pace of the recent seasons; there's definitely strategy stuff going on, but a lot of it is hidden or more subtle. **It isn't a fast-paced, adrenaline one.. but if you're looking for an emotional, character-driven season or a season with focus on nature, Australia is very hard to beat.** Some people might say that the season gets uninteresting after a certain point in the post-merge, but as Reddit's own Neckman once said: ""The endgame villains are the powers of Nature, Ethics and Fate. The Survivors aren't contending with a villainous player, but they're fighting the wilderness, they're fighting their own ethical dilemmas, and they're fighting the unknown.""

It also has a strong enough cast that they deserve to be the stuff of legend: The winner is a major, maaaajor favorite of mine whom I'll rant about at length to anyone who will listen and most who won't, and even aside from the winner, the cast is full of some of the best, most complex, most memorable and beloved characters ever. And on top of all of that, this season contains what I think is **hands down, without question the best episode in the entire history of Survivor;** even if it weren't already great, this whole season would be worth sitting through just for that one alone. 

One problem with this season, though - and the reason it has fallen on my rankings since the last thread - is because a lot of its most pivotal stuff is, for a number of reasons, actually kind of absent from the TV episodes; the story you get in the episodes still makes perfect sense, it isn't awkward or hard to understand.. but there's some important stuff that isn't in there - and the entire season is absolutely a reaction to Borneo and how Borneo was perceived at the time; chronological context is more important here than any other season, especially non-returning player ones. So I feel **Australia is a season that really benefits from external discussion in addition to just viewing**, and you definitely shouldn't watch it before you watch the first season in whose footsteps it was following (or from whose footsteps it was trying to stray.)

**My Personal Ranking:** 9/29

**Overall verdict:** Not something that you should watch if you want anything like newer Survivor, and also shouldn't be your introduction to old-school Survivor, because it's *so* ""old-school-ish"" that it kind of misrepresents the era *and* it relies heavily on context. But if you are interested in something different and have already seen Borneo, this is a damn fine season containing a legendary cast and the single best episode ever, and a very interesting one to discuss, so it's definitely something any serious Survivor fan should check out *fairly* early.",9

Great:  Among the best casts ever.  Pretty much everybody is likable and even the season's villain isn't bad by today's standards (though they remain one of the best characters ever IMO).  I normally don't like when returnees are brought up as a defense of a cast but for AO I make an exception.  There's a reason that 8 people have come back from Australia and I'd say all but two of those returnees was a great character on this season.  It also has two of the best episodes in all of Survivor (one pre-merge, one post-merge) that really show off the cast's strength.  It has one of the best settings ever.  There's also a very clean central storyline that is very easy to digest and enjoy.

Not-so-great:  Australia's post-merge drags quite a lot.  I get why they decided to do three extra days but it does lead to a few dull episodes with one amazing exception. This season more than any other requires a lot of context to appreciate it, which is great if you have the context but can be frustrating without it.  

One more thing:  this season's winner requires a ton of behind-the-scenes info to really appreciate them and their gameplay.  If you browse various boards after finishing this season and are confused as to why they are so revered, don't be alarmed.  ",1

I do recommend watching *Palau* before *Guatemala*.

That said, *Guatemala* is a great season. It has an amazing cultural backdrop that really has only been equaled by *China*, it has a surprisingly strong cast, and it has some interesting gameplay elements that would go on to become series staples.

11.0,Guatemala,cy6z56n,"(**RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!!:** Guatemala contains returning players from season 10. Do *not* watch it until you have seen season 10.)

Guatemala is sort of the forgotten ""black sheep"" of Survivor seasons. It is unique in that, other than one recent season, it is the only season in Survivor history to introduce no players who would later return - primarily because production just kind of hated filming it due to an awful location and some contestants who were super hard to work with off-camera - which of course deters newer fans from going back and checking it out, and it doesn't stand out too strongly in any one particular area, so it just... isn't talked about much. It's mostly just talked about for being the season nobody ever talks about.

This might make you think ""Well, it's probably boring, so I'll skip it!"" - but you shouldn't, if you're seriously into the show. Guatemala has one of the best locations of any Survivor season. One tribe's camp is located in an *actual Mayan ruin!!*, which is just so fucking cool! It has some pretty emotional and evocative moments, it has some contestants who remain popular to this day for being funny or just plain likable, it has a decently crafted long-term storyline, it introduces some twists that would become fixtures of later seasons. Do I think that it's a season I'd instantly recommend to someone? Probably not. But it's a fine season once you reach it in chronological order and not one you should pass over - or, if you're not watching in order, a decent season that's definitely worth checking out at some point. Not one to prioritize like Borneo or Africa or Vanuatu or Palau or Panama or China, but definitely not one to actively put off like Redemption Island or One World. It has some problems (personally, I dislike parts of the boot order and parts of the editing; I think these are most other people's problems as well), but it has a pretty solid cast of characters and a great location that'll leave you feeling like a more complete, educated, entertained Survivor fan for having seen it, even if it won't be in your all-time top 3 or anything.

(And, hell, maybe it will be in your top 3. I know a fucking DIEHARD Guatemala fan who insists that it's the best of the best of the best of the best. She fucking lives, breathes, bleeds, salivates Guatemala. So, again, you really never know until you actually watch the seasons, which is why it may just be best to go in order and see for yourself what ones you like.)

**My Personal Ranking**: 14/29

**Overall verdict**: That this is considered ""decent Survivor"" just speaks to how strong Survivor is as a show, because this is actually some pretty fucking stellar television. It's just that Survivor is often pretty fucking stellar television, often even more than this, so that and the lack of returning players have caused Guatemala to slide through the cracks over the years.

Most seasons won't be zomgstandouts.",4

4.0,Marquesas,cy7cgpj,"There are some people that are really high on Marquesas but I'd like to throw in my opposing opinion.

This season is pretty boring.

There are plenty of seasons without strategic depth that I like, but this is not one of them. The premerge is very boring with only a few interesting confessionals to break up the monotony of the first few episodes. On one tribe pretty much all but 4 people are irrelevant for the entire game and only 2 of them have any significance premerge. The other tribe has a similar amount of duds but has enough to get you through the premerge without being bored to tears.

The postmerge is again, boring. There is a highlight or two but honestly nothing that amazing. I think this season gets a lot more credit than it deserves for paving the way for future seasons. After a mildly interesting middle the season becomes pretty boring again and finishes in a pretty unsatisfying fashion. There are better old school seasons to watch for both characters, story, strategy and survival.

It has one of the best challenges of all time that heavily influences the strategy on the game. 

And that reunion show, wtf is that.

4.0,Marquesas,cy6ykjr,"Marquesas is fucking godly.

Marquesas is also *the* biggest argument in favor of chronological viewing; the sort of inter-season story of 1 through 4, with a payoff this season, is enhanced *so* much with the context of the previous seasons. While Every-Single-Season-In-Chronological-Order is the best way to go if you're watching all the seasons, I think - if you might not see them all or do want to stop going chronological at a certain point - seasons 1-4 are where the chronology is most critical (and then 6/7 are a great follow-up to 4, with 5 - though underrated in my opinion - as skippable if you're not going to watch the whole show.) Marquesas is *revolutionary,* it is *the* most important season to the development of the game after Borneo bar none, and it is the season everybody wanted to exist since episode seven of Borneo.

All chronology aside though, fuck, this is just fantastic television. It is the APEX of post-Borneo Survivor storytelling. I feel, honestly, like it is just about everything that any Survivor season ever could or should hope to be. Its narrative is probably the most complex, complete, and fulfilling of any season's ever, other than maybe the first one. It's so well-told, so rich and deep, and every contestant, by the time they're out, really does have their path explored in a unique, interesting way, and that path ties necessarily into the paths of all the *other* contestants; it's a brilliant network of complex, interweaving narratives. And that isn't to say that every single contestant gets a major or visible edit, but almost all of them do, and even the ones who don't do have storylines of their own.

And those storylines are all pretty fucking excellent, and they culminate in major climaxes - climaxes that are all the more rewarding for how well they were set up. **It doesn't just rely on Big Moments; it sets the stage very well *for* those moments,** it lets you get to know the people involved, their personalities, their positions, their motivations... so the result is that when big things happen, they're really, really big and satisfying.

It's just.. it's amazing: you have so many moments here that are unlike anything that came before, yet are still perfectly set up within *this* narrative to be wonderful television even in a vacuum, and that then set the stage for future seasons. It is a critical turning point due to some amazing climaxes, and the stories that lead to those climaxes are told so well.

It also has what I consider the best and craziest endgame in Survivor history. The last two episodes are just nuuuuuts, they're compelling and exciting and shocking all at once, with what might be my all-time favorite Survivor finale capping it off. So much freaking stuff happens in that endgame and there are so many twists. And with the ultimate outcome being what it is, I think Marq improves even more on a rewatch.

Seriously, Marquesas is just wowzers. It's a hell of a story. Absolutely, definitely, 50000% worth watching.

**My Personal Ranking:** 1/29

**Overall Verdict:** Marquesas is like a too-good-to-be-true fanfiction. If you had, in 2001 after ""Survivor: Africa"", told someone how Marquesas would go - let alone how expertly they'd put together the events into a television story - they'd have said.. what? no, fuck you, that's not possible, stop getting my hopes up. But it happened, and it happened wonderfully. A brilliant and heavily rewarding season even from a modern perspective, and an utterly perfect game-changer after seasons 1-3, Marquesas is juuust under Borneo in terms of what I consider the absolute freaking MUST-watch seasons.",10

Some all-time great characters as well, as well as absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary gameplay, and one of the most intense moments of all time at the final four. You do really get attached to the characters, among them some comedians, some nice people, some good villains, and some of the most emotional people and moments of all time.

Because of how this game is impacted by historical context, some viewers who began with newer seasons of Survivor might have difficulty appreciating the story and game. That's okay though--stay for the cast! There are a lot of fabulous characters here to enjoy.

If they still focused on storytelling like they used to I believe many recent seasons could have been so much better (especially Cambodia) if they let the strategy be less important than the characters since it felt like a lot of the vote offs in Cambodia didn't pack the punch they could have because we didn't have any strong feelings for the characters getting blindsided. Unfortunately, the show now seems to be edited to create as much suspense in the moment as possible and to give the large majority for the audience 2 or 3 characters to root for and a satisfying ending while making a final product that on a re-watch is in every way inferior to the early show.

21.0,Nicaragua,cy6iv0c,"This is Survivor’s most underrated season. Nicaragua may lack for signature strategic moments, but the cast is solid, deep, and quirky, and the season is consistently entertaining from first episode to finale.

The drama never ends. Numerous players develop feuds and rivalries. This helps create an engaging pre-merge, as differences play out and send people home. Multiple quality story arcs run their full course before the merge.

Post-merge will remind new viewers of Second Chances. Voting blocks form and shift and break and reform. It’s pretty much total chaos. Players gain and lose a lot of power in the blink of an eye. And the way it ultimately ends cannot be predicted. If you’re looking for a season that will keep you guessing literally until Probst reads the final jury vote, watch Nicaragua.

Two last things: The person who comes in 4th is one of the forgotten solid post-HvV characters, with a great and complete story arc. Also, fans of Abi Maria will find in Nicaragua a villainess who is just as wonderfully bitchy as the Brazilian. And the embarrassing way she goes out is fantastic. It’s always fun watching a villain get their comeuppance.

Edit: Removed one statement because it was poorly worded.",43
21.0,Nicaragua,cy6n3co,"I think Nicaragua needs a little more love from the fanbase at large...I mean, Dalton Ross ranks it as the worst season of all time, which is hilarious and infuriating simultaneously. I kinda love Nicaragua for a few reasons, but mostly because it has a crazy cast that bounces off of each other in the exact right way to create sparks. It's as if, instead of casting matches, matchboxes and candles to create a harmonious season, they cast 20 pieces of flint and threw them into the jungle to see what happened.

The premerge is fantastic because nobody really has their shit together. Unpredictable characters weave their way through the narrative and leave a trail of nuclear fallout in their wake. In the postmerge, this chaos continues. What really makes Nicaragua pop, however, are the tiny moments that make it sing. In my opinion (and I know this isn't an opinion shared by many), the time between the Final 6 Immunity Challenge and Tribal Council is one of the most suspenseful, intense, terrifying spans that I've seen on Survivor, due to the synchronized emotional reactions and spot on musical cues. I love, love, love Nicaragua, more than most others probably would, and I rank it in my Top 3.",19

21.0,Nicaragua,cy6o5ny,"One of the funniest seasons, with tons of hilarious characters both pre and post merge. It’s clear that most of the players have no real idea what they are doing, which may turn some people off, but personally I love that about it. It does have some vocal detractors, and its detractors really, really dislike it; partly for the reasons I already listed, but also for the seasons’s signature moment in one very unique postmerge episode. Personally however, I enjoy that episode quite a bit, and think it accurately represents the clusterfuck that this season is. As for knocks against it… while I do love the winner, I do think the ending is a little underwhelming because of the circumstance in which it happens, but that’s just a small personal preference. Don’t go into it expecting a strategy-heavy, intelligent cast; go into it appreciating for what it is — a comedy of bizarre Survivor play and funny moments.

21.0,Nicaragua,cy70vgg,"Here, I think the label of ""trainwreck"" is muuuuuch more appropriate than in Gabon, for a number of reasons. Gabon... is also *kind of* a trainwreck, but it's easy to enjoy it aside from that as a simple and satisfying narrative of likable protagonists doing well, and I think it is more cartoonish than trainwrecky. Nicaragua is basically just a trainwreck.

In a fucking excellent way, though. I just do not understand this season's negative reception, at all. I guess if you're looking for great, visible ""strategists"" it might not be the best, though even there I think it's sort of underrated. But regardless of that, this season has an absolutely brilliant cast of lovable, love to hate-able, hilarious, colorful contestants. It's such a fun fucking ride.

Don't watch it first or necessarily early because it does have some kind of funky stuff going on. But absolutely, absolutely watch it with an open mind, if you are into this fanbase and you haven't, because holy fuck its cast is *so* good. This season and SJDS having such negative reputations when I think they're the absolute highlights of post-HvV Survivor is so frustrating.

**My Personal Ranking:** 7/29

**Overall verdict:** Has some kind of funky events/editing that mean you shouldn't watch it first, but one of the best casts ever assembled and one of the high points of modern Survivor. Absolutely one of the highest priorities to watch - maybe *the* highest - as far as the most recent third of the show's run goes.",8

Like Gabon it's a clusterfuck, but I don't think the characters are as enjoyable. And there's an event in the post-merge that completely soured the season for me and for a lot of other viewers.

As far as pros, I do really appreciate Nicaragua's art direction, which features a really cool Spanish conquistador theme. The winner is fun, but I still think there are much better Survivor winners out there. And Nicaragua certainly doesn't have a shortage of great humor moments. To me though, there are funnier seasons out there without as many negative patches.",3

The season's cast is easily one of the best and should entertain you from watching the opening scenes to the reunion. The season isn't the strongest strategically, but it's comedy by the barrel full.

A lot of people dislike the season because of an event that happens at the final 9, but I think it gives the season a lot more depth and really shows [how exhausting Survivor can be on the human body.](/spoiler) The storylines are also quite good, giving us one of the greatest underdogs ever.

14.0,Fiji,cy74gvx,"The problem with Fiji is that it is over-saturated with villains. I don't think there is another season like it in that regard. In a 19-person cast, you can count the number of likable heroes on one hand, while the number of villains nears double-digits.

You have to watch it, step away, and revisit it to get the most out of it.

Lots of slap stick comedy though!",5
14.0,Fiji,cybs5z4,"In a world before the ""dark years"" in the early to mid 20's, Fiji was the titleholder for the unanimously agreed upon worst season. Since it has been proven Survivor can get much, much worse than Fiji, it has undergone a sort of renaissance, where people have started to notice the gems hidden throughout it's rough surface.

A major game-changing twist governs the outcome of the pre-merge to an unprecedented and very frustrating extent. Amidsts this very dark and depressing war period, there exist a grand total of 19 castaways, which production doesn't really know what to do with. Half of them are used sporadically, with very little airtime in between their few moments. A lot of the others are just plainly unlikable. 

But again--Survivor can do *much* worse than Fiji, and for having a lot of roughness, there is also a wildly unpredictable and strategically advanced post-merge game and a few players who are really worth rooting for and then some. Again, this is a season featuring a lot of hidden little gems, so watch with your eyes open. 

Not a good season for beginners. There is nothing so ""must see!"" about it that you can't keep it for later on when you're running out of stuff to watch. ",7
14.0,Fiji,cy707os,"This season is one of the most underrated seasons of all time. Fiji has a rich history of cannibalism, and the art department absolutely nails this. The pre-merge, while not the greatest, still has some worthwhile parts to it. There's one character in particular that gets a lot of hate, and while I understand it, [It's interesting for me to see how a person like Rocky deteriorates as he's coping with a nicotine withdrawal and living in one of the worst situations a contestant could be put through. This actually ties in really well with the theme of cannibalism, a practice that was used in Fiji's history.](/spoiler)

However, even if you might not enjoy the pre-merge as much as I do, the season has some really enjoyable characters that make it really far as one of the greatest pairings ever. The post-merge is also one of the most strategically interesting of all time. It contains the rise-and-fall arc of [the Four Horsemen](/spoiler), a rise-and-fall which I would call one of the best. On top of that, a moment happens at the final six where one person makes one of the most innovative strategic moves of all time, and eventually puts one person in the most intense catch-22 ever, something I've spoken about [here](https://redd.it/3x5jhy) (DO NOT READ UNTIL AFTER WATCHING FIJI)

14.0,Fiji,cy6zq1u,"Fiji is a polarizing season. Lots of people hate it, some vocal people love it, I'd say its overall reception is neutral bordering on negative. Personally, ""neutral bordering on negative"" is exactly how I feel about it, too. Whenever you do watch it, you'll take some good stuff out of it: the winner is fantastic, one or two of the characters are probably among Survivor's best, and there are some super fun and complex moments along the way.

But... those moments and characters are few and far between. A lot of the episodes are just ""blah"" and uninspiring, and massive amounts of the cast are underedited nothings whom you'll have no reason to care about; among those who aren't, most are unlikable ones you probably won't enjoy, leaving this season a kind of ugly one. I don't dislike it - I'm ambivalent towards it - but I rank it lowest out of all the seasons I don't dislike, and it definitely has some really strong flaws. And those flaws are also things that make it, just... *weird.* It's a *weird* season, it has weird twists, it has weird editing, it has a weird assortment of contestants, so it's certainly not something you should start with, because it is really not a good representation of, like, *anything* about the show.

If you're watching in order, watch it when you get to it; otherwise, I think that there is utterly no reason to put this confusing and regrettable one particularly high on your to-do list. Despite the occasional gem, the overall feeling of this season is basically ""Cook Islands 2.0."" Location is freaking stunning, though.

(But again, of course, that's just one person's opinion. Some people utterly adore Fiji, and you might be one of them. So it's certainly not something you should skip.)

**My Personal Ranking:** 21/29

But some of these people were so blind with bitterness I almost wanted to straight up skip the rest of the finale and just google who won.

The premerge feels almost like a vacation because of the safety of it all, which is magnified even further by the return of redemption island. One tribe ends up being very fun to watch, while the other, filled with some of the stupidest players to ever compete on survivor, is tedious to watch and quickly self-destructs. The postmerge improves, but is frustrating to watch because players refuse to make moves to further themselves in the game. The boot order is awful throughout, with interesting characters being sacrificed in favor of egomaniacs.

Overall, this is a season that was aptly labeled Survivor Lite: it isn't bad by any means, but because of the combination of redemption island, the comfort of loved ones, and the lack of any real difficulty actually surviving, this season feels very safe. If you are looking for a relaxing, easy to watch season, and don't mind some frustration, watch this one.

This season also makes use of Redemption Island, a game mechanic that allows eliminated castaways to compete against each other for a chance to return to the game. 

Once you've familiarized yourself with the returning players and the unusual mechanics of this season, the sad truth is that Blood vs Water mostly washes out as a fairly average Survivor season. A lot of great storylines are set up, but large chunks of the season are very predictable and many characters are under-edited and not consistent or influential players in the story.

So I definitely don't recommend it. It's not particularly *bad,* but it is very predictable, it is often very frustrating, it is often rather dull, and it contains the RI twist yet again. I think it, along with One World, is the definition of mediocre Survivor, despite one Tribal Council that I really like and a pre-FTC boot whom I adore. There's no real reason to dive right into this one - and since half the cast are returning players, and the initial twist/tribal division is very unorthodox, there's a lot of reason not to.

The emotional connections between players is nice development for the cast, but I've always found too many of them to be over-dramatic to the point of being boring, especially when wacky players are either out early or turned into bland strategists. On the other hand, it's nice to see some nobodies from seasons past and a good amount of newbies get interesting moments, even though one returnee may test your tolerance of third person speech.

The pre-merge is great, but the post-merge is dull and predictable. Editing teases and tricks you in the worst way possible and it gets aggravating over time, but it doesn't ruin the season.

Redemption Island is at its least worst here thanks to drama and a new twist that never really works out, but it's still not a good addition to the season.

The season is also one of three to feature Redemption Island, but most people agree that the twist was at its best in this season.

-Funny moments. In particular, CI gives birth to one of the best Survivor comic relief characters of all-time. It also has one of Survivor's best WTF moments ever and some other really hilarious and entertaining moments.

-A fantastic finale. I personally love a particular moment at the Final 4, and the finish is exciting and leads to easily a top 5 Survivor winner.

Why most people dislike CI:

-Uneven editing. CI had some great stars, but those people took up most of the screen time. So it depends on how much that matters to you. As long as the winner isn't insanely obvious (see: S30), it doesn't matter to me.

-The racial division. In many ways, this makes CI the most controversial Survivor season ever. Luckily, I think all of the contestants handle it delicately, and it could have gone a LOT worse.

-The twists. Many people think that the season was rigged because of the multiple twists this season and their results. As someone who refuses to believe Survivor is ever rigged, I don't give this much stock.

-The god idol. S12 and S13 featured an early version of the HII which protected the holder after the votes were cast, which a lot of people think is unfair and makes the season's results less valid as a result.

Basically, you either enjoy the narrative or you sour at the flaws. I know I'm in the (vocal) minority for this, but I personally think CI's pros outweigh its cons.",13
13.0,Cook Islands,cy7e15u,"One of my favorite seasons. Beautiful visuals, fantastic challenges. My favorite winner of all time. One of my favorite story arcs ever. My favorite twist of all time (not the way tribes were initially divided, the other one). The single greatest love story ever told on television. And some of my favorite players and characters of all time in Billy, Cao Boi, Flicka, Nate, Penner and Yul. Plus some of the best returning players to play THREE TIMES in Candice, Ozzy, Parvati & Penner. Did I mention Jonathan Penner is on this season? A lot of people call this season boring but I find it anything but. Great season for someone new to the show, especially if they plan on watching Micronesia, Heroes vs Villains, South Pacific, Philippines or Blood vs Water. Cook Islands is basically a prerequisite season for all future returning player seasons, and for my money, it's a very fun experience.",7
13.0,Cook Islands,cy6t0b4,"I do have to say I am quite disappointed with the Cook Islands when I rewatched it a few months ago. The editing is a bit patchy [due to it being a 20 person cast] and there a twists galore which definitely impact on the outcome of the season/ Having said that there are some unique characters scattered among the cast, especially a few pre merge boots. This isn’t must watch Survivor but it does have a compelling story line which some people may enjoy.

13.0,Cook Islands,cy6kjey,"I find it hilarious how, in a racially divided season, [4 WHITE PEOPLE and a black guy (who was at the bottom of the alliance) almost pagonged all of the minorities](/spoiler)Can you imagine the controversy?",13
13.0,Cook Islands,cy7dfh4,"I've heard people say that they either love or hate CI.  Personally I don't know how someone could have such a strong opinion on it.  Has some good moments, some really bad moments and a lot of nothing moments.  Definitely the season that I have the least opinion on.",3
13.0,Cook Islands,cyh850q,"A lot of the people will describe this as a love it or hate it season. Personally, I didn't hate it, but didn't quite love it; it was more of a really like it season.

Perhaps the biggest flaw of this season, and one of the most common complaints, is the edit. There are 20 survivors, and some never get much of an edit at all, while others are consistently focused on. This does detract from the season a bit, but I don't think it's as big of a flaw as people make it out to be. I think that a lot of people here appreciate an edit that tells a story and sets up characters that have arcs, and that's just not what this season is, and it's not necessarily a bad thing. It may suck that some survivors get virtually no airtime, but this season is one that is more focused on portraying events as they happen, and characters realistically, rather than aligning them with a certain arc. While this may feel uneven, I think it's mainly just different, and not as big of a deal as people make it out to be.

Other common complaints of this season revolve around the way the tribes are divided, which is by race, and the twists. I think that this was a questionable decision, but it ended up working out fine. None of the tribes are treated differently and none of them are edited to portray a stereotype, so this ends up actually being pretty interesting, and I feel like people just freaked out the minute they heard ""separated by race"" without thinking about it at all. There are some questionable or unfair twists later in the season, but this doesn't really make it any less entertaining.

What I love about this season is that it is a season where the players' choices affect them. In some seasons, like Cambodia, people seem to be voted off based on random things that happened week to week. Then there are seasons like Borneo where everything seems to follow a set path from the beginning. With this season, however, every decision the players and tribes have to make branches out into two possible outcomes, and when they make a choice, the consequences always come back to haunt them as much as the rewards benefit them. This made most of the game a blast to watch. 

Some of the postmerge is a bit predictable and while some of the characters that make it far in the game are a bit flat, they are some of the nicest to ever play the game and incredibly likable.

I was dreading watching this season because I wanted to watch FvF and HvV, in which four castaways from this season return, while having the backstory of those characters, and everyone and their mothers said this was a dull season with terrible editing. In reality, though, this season is extremely entertaining to watch despite its flaws. ",3
13.0,Cook Islands,cy6zz8a,"Like all seasons, Cook Islands is worth a watch--and when you don't know what is going to happen, it will grip you. But perhaps more than any other season, Cook Islands suffers hard upon rewatch. This season features 20 castaways, many of whom are given minimal, shallow edits. While most of the cast is not great, there are absolutely a few standout characters worth watching for. They are initially divided into 4 tribes based on race: White, Black, Asian, Latino. I wish I were kidding about that. Again, the story will carry the season through a very dull cast the first time through. Four castaways from this season have each returned to play again 2 more times, so regardless, this season is important to watch purely as preparation for the All-Star seasons that feature these players. ",4
13.0,Cook Islands,cy6zqm8,"I think this season is a lot like waiting at the Roads and Maritime Services (or the equivalent wherever you live). It takes a long time, there are a lot of boring people there, nothing terribly interesting happens and you just want to get out of there as soon as possible. Of of the twenty people cast, only one or two people are worth watching.

**Wilbur's Rank:** 27/31",4
13.0,Cook Islands,cy6zitq,"Cook Islands is often a kind of polarizing season. Personally, I really, really, *reaaally* hate it. I think it's incredibly dull, I think its only ostensibly and potentially notable storylines are the direct result of lame twists and have their effects diminished by the minor edits or dull personalities of the contestants they involved, I think it's *easily* the worst cast in Survivor history (maybe bested by S26) despite a few stars.. **When people just say ""CI is boring"", I think that's giving it too much credit,** because it's *also* a convoluted mess of horrible editing, boring contestants, and pointless twists - one of which, the F3, stuck around and became a fixture of the franchise. Eeek.

But, that said!: A lot of people do really enjoy it, so it can't hurt to check it out, because maybe you'll be one of them. Consensus is often that it's good the first time around, then sucks on the rewatch (though I didn't care for it the first time, either, after the first couple episodes.) However, even outside of my typical ""watch in order!"" recommendation, I really wouldn't recommend this one as an early season. Even if you like some of its storylines, its *massive* amount of underedited contestants and bafflingly large array of twists leave this a very ""un-Survivor-y"" season that I don't think accurately represents what's often great about the franchise. I think the only reason to put this one anywhere even remotely early in your Survivor viewing is because a few of its contestants came back later on... but honestly, even then, two of them barely matter in this season and were kind of headscratcher picks that shined more on later seasons, and I think the other two have stories that are pretty much divided by season and don't require Cook Islands to be viewed before the others. So yeah, there is little to no reason to prioritize this, but maybe you might like it.

**My Personal Ranking:** 27/29

**Overall verdict:** I think it's super dull and much of the time actively awful with its twists and editing. It does have some fans, though, so you might enjoy it - but even though it has some players whom production liked enough to bring back later on, I don't think it should be one of the first few seasons you watch by any means.",4

A lot of twists this season that really kept you on your feet, but I like that the twists were sort of pre-set, so it wasn't an obvious freebie to one group or the other. 

Challenges weren't anything that stuck out to me, except for one really interesting one that I won't mention for spoilers. A lot of really really great characters in this season that I could see being underrated (Keep in mind I have not talked to anyone about survivor), which might be why this season is lower on this list.

It was also one of the few seasons where I couldn't tell you who was going to win at ANY point in this game. I feel like normally the edit is sort of hinting at the winner the whole time, but the edit in this season is fantastic in that way.

Was it the best season of survivor ever? Nah. But I think any survivor fan would enjoy this season for what it is.

SIDENOTE: Watching chronologically completely blind, this season was the first season where I felt there was some SERIOUS strategy/plotting from more than just one or two people. These survivors made survivor look more like a game than a TV show, which was nice.",1

I think it's better to think of this season less as an ensemble and more of a Breaking Bad type TV show with Walter as the main character, a couple of key supporting players, and some people who just factor in a little. And to me the story it tells is pretty magnificent.

I think the key to this season is letting go that Survivor has to be a full ensemble. If Russell annoys you and you hate him on your TV this will be awful. But there's greatness in this season, and I wish more people saw it.",22

If you want to fully understand Survivor, how it works, and discuss it on the internet, it’s an absolute must-watch at some point, but make sure that when you’re watching it you keep an open mind about what is actually going on the entire time, remembering that the editors pack hundreds of hours of footage into 14 43-minute episodes.

19.0,Samoa,cy6k0hv,Extremely unbalanced editing brings down what would otherwise have been a great story.,28
19.0,Samoa,cyadll2,"One of my friends recently got brought back into the Survivor fold after we started watching episodes together. We were talking about it in front of another friend and he decided to give it a watch. My friend who had never seen any Survivor before would have made the people of this sub so proud, he went with the first episode of the first season. He couldn't finish the first episode. He wanted to see a gameshow not a lifestyle documentary. 

So I ask him some questions about what he wanted from Survivor? He says stuff like gameplay, cool challenges, better video quality. So I think about my friend, what I know he enjoys (Magic, NFL, Video games) and decide that the best way to keep him engaged is to give him a villain. So we load up Samoa on Hulu. First off, the season looks so much better in 1080 than 480 (duh, but I watched it on YouTube). Secondly, Hulu without commercials is probably necessary for binging.

The season opener starts a lil slow as we get to know people; my friend didn't understand what the marooning represented and why it was important. It isn't until Russell starts being an asshole that my friend, and his girlfriend overhearing stuff from the kitchen, start cracking up. Bad guy assholes can be pretty funny. Every so often I ask 

- Who do you think won? 

- Are you rooting for Russell Hantz or against him?

- Who else stands out to you?

The answers are awesome. Usually Russell is going to win, they are hoping to see Russell win but sometimes want bad things to happen to him, and Shambo and Dave Ball stand out (Clothelined by the Clothseline, I Won Chicken) aside from the Russell show. We made it through five episodes and they are hooked. They want to know what evil deeds will this asshole do next and if he will get away with it. All the while, they are getting exposed to the game mechanics, the beautiful sets, Jeff's banter, and just how brutal the elements can be. My hope after Samoa is that we either go to Tocantins (for Coach!) or HVV if they must have more Russell. 

So my review of Samoa would go like this:

- While Survivor purists may dismiss Samoa as unbalanced or poorly edited, it unleashed one of the greatest characters in the history of the franchise. The season has an almost mythical feel of good vs evil, with the very elements of Samoa themselves passing judgment on the castaways for the decisions they make. Samoa is one of the stepping stones towards the modern game; I think Samoa is one of the best seasons of the show in terms of narrative and a real example of the show evolving. While purists of the series find fault with Survivor: Samoa's emphasis on a big bad villain, I find it to be an editorial decision geared towards producing the most entertaining product. This season features stunning geography, underdog stories, great examples of heroes and villains, and some classic characters. It's a pretty fun season and a great way to get into modern Survivor, from both a production and game play standpoint. I would say that Samoa is pretty solid as a first season to watch.",10

*Tier: Middle/Top*

**Cast:** This was a good cast. Many great characters, one of the biggest characters of allllll tiiiiime in fact, and a boot list that allowed for entertainment all season long. Loved it!

**Twists**: There were no twists in Samoa, unless you count an early merge which probably saved the season. 

**Shining Light:** The dynamics of the characters, the season was gripping because of the way all these people bounced off of each other in spectacular fashions.

**You Should Watch If:** You're a fan of survivor who has seen a few seasons already. You don't mind having one player shoved in your face the entire season long. You like underdogs. You like when the good guy suceeds.

**One Word:** Overkill

**Final Words:** People rag on this season way too much. It's clouded by an overedited player, but that player was incredibly novel at the time and brought survivor to a whole different era. The episodes are exciting, and the outcome is unexpected. I think it's a blast, but just not the best one to start off with.",4

Don't start with this season. Don't put this season anywhere near your starting point. It's just about the biggest misrepresentation of the franchise that I can possibly imagine. No other season has an edit or narrative like this one, and that is not an endorsement of it.

I think it has a great cast on paper, I think in theory it could have been a top, like, 6 season of all time, but none of that matters. What you'll watch here is the edited product, and the edited product is so fucking frustrating, so weird, and SUCH a misrepresentation of everything about Survivor that it should not be anywhere near the first one you watch.

Some people do like it in spite of its edit, so maybe it'll end up in *your* top 6 or higher... but I cannot stress enough how much this season is an anomaly that should not be anywhere close to the first season you watch.

**My Personal Ranking:** 26/29

**Overall verdict:** For the love of all the gods, don't watch this season anywhere near first.

8.0,All-Stars,cy6ius3,"All-Stars isn’t for everybody, but I enjoy it as Survivor’s “darkest” season. This isn’t like any other returnee season — or really any other season in general. All-Stars is a Greek Tragedy in which everybody either dies horribly by the end, or survives but is worse off for their bad experiences.

There’s a ton of dark drama. Beloved characters get their throats slit by cackling villains. Friends backstab one another and then shrug it off. FTC is beyond bitter. The season is remarkably similar to Shakespearean plays or ASOIAF plots that center around bloody struggles for power spiraling out of control. Nobody wins in all-out war. Whether you find tragic narrative interesting or off-putting will determine if you will enjoy All-Stars.

We can’t talk about All-Stars without giving fair warning that it contains the lowest point of all Survivor. There’s no way That Scene can be portrayed positively. Which is why I think the editors left it in so raw. They had no choice. It’s a horrible moment in which everybody involved looks really bad — cast and show both.

Thankfully, That Scene comes midway in the season, leaving plenty more dark drama to unfold. If you want a break from Survivor’s typical cheery, upbeat seasons, then check out this entertaining tragedy.",29
8.0,All-Stars,cy6jews,"Just some commentary:

It is very telling that the very first returnee season is often considered one of the ""darkest"" seasons of Survivor. With trickery, lies, and backstabbing happening all over the place, a group of returning players who've all played the game once resulted in the most bitter Jury ever at the time.

They're all experienced players. All of them made it to the merge on their original seasons. That the very first returnee season was made up of competitors who were experienced AND bitter due to how they were booted form the game is a fantastic indication that Survivor is and has always been about relationships, about social capital, and that a bitter jury is the fault of the people who created it.",8
8.0,All-Stars,cy74uqx,"To be honest, it reads to me like Survivor fan fiction that just magically became real. It's certainly Survivor's darkest season and is one of few seasons where the in-game results had extremely dramatic results in the contestant's personal lives. It's got a lot of critics because of how negative it feels to a lot of people, but I think there's entertainment in the drama of it, and it's still mandatory viewing for old-school Survivor in my book.

I do recommend watching most of the preceding seasons before this one - the only one you can skip with little consequence is S5. Even just Probst's introduction in the first 10 minutes of the season spoils the winners of S1, 2, 3, and 6, so beware of that.

*Tier: Bottom/Middle*

----

**Cast:** The cast is amazing. If you've seen Seasons 1-7, you'll be PUMPED to see all these players interact. With one or two surprises, these players are all the ones you would expect to see again, and see them again you shall, just in a sort of odd environment. Top tier cast is what I'm getting at, one of the best of all time.

**Twists**: The first time Survivor ever used more than two tribes in a season, and it was a mixed bag I'd say. Definitely worked better in latter seasons.  The All-Star concept itself was a twist, and one I think is AWESOME, as you'll come to undestand further if you watch Cambodia and/or Heroes vs. Villains. 

**Shining Light:** Most people would agree the first one or two episodes are a Survivor fan's wet dream. They're fantastic, magical, epic, and so on. Then some shit goes down, shit that had never happened and will never happen again in the context of survivor, and hell springs forth. I'm not talking about just one thing, that description applies to multiple issues that arise. By the end, if you have a dark sense of humor you'll be laughing, and if you don't? You'll be wishing the season hadn't taken such a surprising and bleak turn.

**You Should Watch If:** You like watching houses burn to ash. You have an affinity for romance. You can push through awkwardness and uncomfortable situations. You are a true survivor fan ready to embrace the cold hard truth.

**One Word:** Vicissitudious

**Final Words:**  If you want to maintain a certain fairytale viewpoint in regards to some of survivor's classic players, don't watch this season. It flips the script on everything you thought you knew about the first seven seasons and what Survivor means.",1

8.0,All-Stars,d07zod3,"I finished this season last week. I honestly REALLY enjoyed it, but I think there were some outside factors going into it.

1) I'm currently watching all survivor seasons chronologically, and I am going into them COMPLETELY blind. I know absolutely nothing about future seasons (other than S30, which is what got me into survivor in the first place).

2)The only things I do know about seasons before I watch them is information I get from this thread, which is why I think I enjoyed this season SOO much. 

Backstory: I had just finished S7: expectations were unrealistically high for that season, and you can read my mini-review for it if you'd like. I expected a lot, and got a lot, but overall was slightly dissapointed. The opposite happened here. 

I read A LOT of negative things about this season. Most of them had validity behind them, but I was actually really happy with this season. It absolutely is dark, and some of it is dark not in just the game, but for people's real lives. Ignoring these things though, this season was fantastic. The first survivor where I felt EVERYONE was strategizing, and it really felt like an all-stars season. Backstabs, alliances, and great characters make for a surprisingly good season.

Had this season been as hyped as S7 is, I probably would've been dissapointed, but because I went in with low expectations, I really, really enjoyed it. ",1

Pacific",cy6k43e,"This often gets lumped in with seasons 22 and 24 as the worst three seasons of Survivor. While this is by no means a strong season, it is miles ahead of the other two in terms of entertainment value. At the very least, there are some interesting/weird social dynamics that occur on one tribe that is worth watching.",26
23.0,"South
Pacific",cy7grlk,"I'm really happy this season isn't in the bottom three like last time, but the negative votes still make me sad :(


Anyway I love this season so so so much, and I actually think it benefits from coming right on the heels of Redemption Island. In my opinion, SoPa (S23) is like a photo negative of Season 22.  So many of the same surface themes carry over, but turn out completely different than the way you expect. 


One of the main story arcs of the season is how the two returnees interact with the rest of the cast.  It must be noted here that the previous two times Survivor has done this format, the former players were almost god-like, revered and/or feared by the cast. This time...not so much.  From the get-go, one of these returnees is a laughingstock and the other will soon be left seriously out of the loop by his tribemates.  And the whole time these returnees are out there, they DEMAND respect, proving great foils to each other.  Their story arcs are intimately tied into this arrogance and have some of the most poetic endings Survivor has crafted. 

In this similar vein, one of the other major storylines is some of the cast actively trying not to be like the cast from the previous season. It's hilarious and fascinating, and whenever these contestants feel themselves veering towards the fate of the S22 cast, they make moves to flip the script - whether or not these moves are actually strategic is practically inconsequential (the ""strategic"" decision in Episode 7 exemplifies this).


In fact...there's actually an incredible amount of bad strategy in this season. But what SoPa does so well is that it goes out of it's way to explain why these characters have the motivations they do.  Like yes these are horrible game moves, but the editors never leave you in the dark as to why these players are choosing to go these routes in the first place.


Which leads me to another criticism that SoPa often faces, that there is no one to root for. I personally rooted for the winner the whole season so I never quite had that complaint, but I understand where people are coming from. That being said, South Pacific shares quite a bit in common with the Saw franchise, where the entertainment value really doesn't come from rooting for everyone to make it to the end, but rather from watching the downfalls of the majority of the cast. And there are some truly delicious and entertaining downfalls. 


I would say that if you're watching South Pacific in chronological order, prepare to have your expectations subverted.  But if you choose to seek out this season, revel in the darkness of the characters and the plot, accept that the strategy is not the shining star of the season, and appreciate the hilarity of a cast who desperately wants to be as far away from the returnees as humanly possible. 


Final note: this season has some really, really funny moments that really stand out on the rewatch.

Pacific",cy6o2x7,"Easily my favorite from the “dark ages” of Survivor. There are plenty of legitimate knocks against it; the season mostly revolves around the same four players, all of whom are very polarizing; there is a lot of tediousness and contrived suspense; and lots of characters are essentially ignored. But it also features some of the darkest and most sociologically intriguing stuff the show has ever seen, especially towards the end. It doesn’t hurt that I am an absolutely humungous fan of this season’s winner and literally everything they say and do. Lots of people find the dark stuff more uncomfortable than intriguing, and I can’t say blame them, and while the winner is mostly very popular, most people don’t tend to think they redeem the season quite as much as I do. In any case though I’d say it’s head and shoulders above the rest of the unholy trinity of 22-24, and you should definitely try to keep an open mind about watching it.

I think there are some sort of worthwhile background characters, but overall it's really not worth the time.

*Tier: Bottom/Middle*

**Cast:** It's not the worst cast, but the way Jeff hyped these players was in no way justified. Not many characters jump out, and those that do often jump for unsavory reasons. I mean, what is there to say about the Dirty 30? They make a better clique than a survivor cast. 

**Twists**: Three tribes is a good twist, and one that worked well in this pre-merge. The extra vote comes into play and, regardless of the outcome, I think it's a good addition to the game mechanics. The opening episode twist involving a perilous choice created a fun dynamic. The twists were actually very good this season.

**Shining Light:** There are many dark and awkward moments, but the funny ones that stick out are very, very funny. When you reach one of these special moments sprinkled in the season, you'll grin and feel good for a short while. The winner's path to victory is also unique, and some may appreciate it.

Even besides that, I think the season was just sort of *dull.* There are, like, two episodes that I really enjoyed. Contrast that with SJDS where there are only two episodes I *didn't* really enjoy, and you have something there is no reason to start with and really no reason to watch if you aren't seeing every season.

It's not even just about the ugliness, which some people might enjoy because they find it funny or whatever; I think it's just a dreary ""meh"" most of the time. Pointless season.

That said, I feel like this will be automatically downvoted based on that by many people.

*HOWEVER*

I will take up arms and defend this season. I don't think it is a subpar season.  I believe it is an AVERAGE season, somewhere around the likes of Australian Outback or Palau.

1. [Mike Holloway] (/spoiler) was a great underdog story.  In a cast filled with mostly unlikeable people, they were the legitimate underdog.  [After Hod Rod (Hey bro, come to Rodney Bowl) blew the group's plan to vote out Mike, Mike went on the defensive.  His move at the auction was a subpar move from a strategic sense, and he paid for it by immediately becoming target #1.  However, through an incredible immunity run, he managed to get to the Final 3 and dominated the final tribal council.] (/spoiler)

2. It introduced a new element to the game, in the [Extra Vote](/spoiler) advantage.  While I hate advantages being sold at auction, I love this new twist, as it can completely shift the game.  [However, in the hands of Dan ""The Man"" Foley, it ended up being wasted.](/spoiler)

3. Great Pre-Merge.  The Pre-Merge of this game was really enjoyable.  Watching the bromance of Joaq/Hotrod, the introduction of Jeli, and Howler Monkeys doin' it by the white collars, it was a lot of fun.  [However, it didn't carry into the post-merge as many of the seemingly strong characters were voted off early, like Max, Vince, So, and Joaquin.](/spoiler)

This season had a lot of potential with a lot of these characters.  Post-merge kind of put this into a mid to lower tier, but this is not a bottom 5 season.  There are MUCH worse seasons then  this.

My review:

- Worlds Apart feels like a sequel to Cagayan as the analogues of Blue Collar vs White Collar vs No Collar to Brains vs Beauty vs Brawn are plentiful if not perfect. The biggest detraction from this season is a persistent and escalating theme of negativity and the shunning of people based upon their differences. The other real problem is the results of the this season sort of forced the editors hand so instead of a tale of politics, big moves, and the importance of society we get what seems like an increasingly obvious march to the end.

[Just look at that top six, with their edits, and try to tell me any of them but Mike were winning...](/spoiler)

Good Merges (Like SJDS) Take the small character moments and little bits of story we recieved in the first half of the season and uses them as building blocks to craft the story.


Worlds Apart however is like it was made by two different editing teams. The team that made the Premerge and the Postmerge.

The Narogote Underdog story that was setup and given promise after the swap. The Outsiders renegaded and the Positive Underdogs were Pagonged

Shirin the Outsider, was outcast for being too passionate about her game. Was on the outside of her original tribe. Swapped and then lost her BFF on the island. Tried to do alot to fit in, but then was unceremoniously eliminated (Unless you count the people who hated her all season applauding her exit)

The Blue Collar Tribe, For a tribe that had its story changing Every Episode; Dans the Asshole, Mike's the Asshole, Now Rodneys the Asshole! Sierra's an outsider, Sierra is in the core group, Lindsay is a voice of Reason, Lindsay is a screaming banshee. We were given all of these stories with them about how Mike was annoying the tribe and Rodney planned to take him out, only for the merge to happen and Mike becomes Superman and Rodney becomes a bumbling fool.

Worlds Apart is an Average Season (As Opposed to Bottom 3 for me) if you ONLY watch from the merge onwards. And even then there are some really weird storytelling quirks",1

Admittedly, save from one challenge (That without one specific asset, would fall into the same category as the rest), the challenges are... unconventional to say the least. The story of the season isn't fantastic, and there's some twists in there that are below par.

As for the season - The location is pretty cool. The challenges aren't bad either, save for a few (and the FIC is awesome). The gameplay is lacking but isn't difficult/frustrating to watch a la One World or RI.

The big knock I always hear about Thailand is that there isn't anyone to root for. I don't disagree, but going into the season with the mindset of ""all these people suck"" will make the season less fun to watch.

Go into it expecting to watch a unique story with a unique winner and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Sometimes Survivor isn't about rooting for the heroes.",10
5.0,Thailand,cy773pu,"**Tomandgreek's Season Overview**

---

*Tier: Bottom/Middle*

----

**Cast:** The cast is probably the biggest detriment to the season. The memorable ones, all of them, are memorable for something negative (with I think one exception). There are a good deal of snoozers, and some complete slimeballs too! Throw in multiple crazy people, and that's Thailand. 

**Twists**: Hah, the major twist is a spoiler so I'm not going to name it, but the way it unfolds and how it screws a certain player is a highlight of the season. This twist has never been done since, but I would like to see it occur once more! Also, you could say team captains picking tribes was sort of a twist.

**Shining Light:** I found the winner's path to victory an absolute wild ride, and enjoyed seeing how they maneuvered their way to the win. It made the season for me. Also, the final immunity challenge is one of my favorites.

**You Should Watch If:** You like old-school survivor. You can survive an episode or two of nothingness. You spell your name with two B's. You want to see a legitimate sociopath play survivor.

**One Word:** Loony

**Final Words:** The first few episodes and the last few episodes don't make up for the horribly boring middle few, but they help make the season worth a look. It's not actually that bad when you simmer down and look at the big picture. In fact, it's fascinating and very different from any other survivor season. The winner's game is a masterpiece, all you have to do is stare at it and bask in it's artistry.",7

5.0,Thailand,cy6w473,"I think Survivor: Thailand best illustrates how sometimes these threads can be sort of unreliable. Many people will say ""A lame season, except for the winner, but the winner doesn't make it worth watching""; on the other hand, I feel very strongly that Thailand is *totally* worth watching - *except* for the winner, whom I really can't stand. And I know that I'm not the only one who feels this way, and there are those who love it even more than I do. There are diehard Thailand fans, and who's to say they're wrong? Thailand illustrates why you really should give every season a try. Maybe you'll dislike it, but maybe you won't. Maybe you'll join the cool kids' table of Thailand fans; there are dozens of us!

That said, I don't think Thailand is perfect by any means, and I certainly wouldn't *start* here. It doesn't play out in an exceptionally interesting way, culminating in a win I hate. One or two of the episodes do feel like kinda pointless wastes of time. A fair amount of contestants are underedited or forgettable - certainly more than in any of the first four seasons. **It has its flaws, and it isn't the first season I'd show someone trying to get into the show, or even one of the first,** because every single thing I like about it is done better with less drawbacks somewhere else. It's not a standout season of Survivor.

But **it also has its strengths** - strengths that *you are missing out on* if you just shrug your shoulders and say ""Eh, Thailand's supposed to suck, right? I got no reason to watch it."" Thailand has some of my all-time favorite characters, some of the most colorful and memorable. Thailand has one of my picks for the best pairs of back-to-back episodes *ever* in the history of the franchise; excluding finales, I can really only think of a couple of pairs that top it, and pretty much none outside of Marquesas/Pearl Islands. It has a long-term tribal narrative that I think is very satisfying and set up very well. It has some super bold production decisions and twists that are really unlike anything that came before. Production-wise - the props and sets and whatnot - it has maybe my favorite aesthetics of every season. And a lot of people do have a great fondness for the polarizing winner.

So no, Thailand isn't perfect, and you shouldn't start here. Or, if you're a more recent fan, this should definitely not be your introduction into old-school Survivor. But I feel that it is a lot more fun, daring, and satisfying than it's almost always given credit for being, and if you're a more serious Survivor fan who has seen most of the seasons, I really don't think this one should be tossed aside entirely. There is some *really* good stuff here that for me outweighs the faults and that is definitely worth seeing. I think it adds more good to Survivor canon than bad, and it's easily worth experiencing the good.

**My Personal Ranking**: 13/29

**Overall verdict**: Do you absolutely, utterly *need* to watch Survivor: Thailand? No, unless you're watching every season in order (which I think you should.) It's the only one of the first 7 seasons I don't think is must-watch material. But it isn't even close to the last season I'd tell someone to watch, and it does have some really colorful characters, great production stuff, and excellent moments that you're totally missing out on if you just write it off.",9

also clay jordan is an incredible character, and sook jais downfall is extremely emotional, especially in the erin boot episode. that is a type of episode we would never get in modern survivor it is just such an anomaly.

In both seasons, there was a core alliance of 4 or 5 people, one of whom was FAR AND AWAY the best physically, mentally, socially, strategically, etc etc etc, and the rest of the group smiled all the way to 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th place.",5

Maybe it just disappointed me more, since I always knew ""Certain Returnee v. Certain Other Returnee"" was going to turn out bad but ""Fans v. Favorites 2"" at least had a chance at being entertaining?

I'm not sure how to put it into words.  I really don't know what comparison I can make between the two to justify it, since they're both completely abhorrent in basically every meaningful way.  Maybe it's the uncomfortable ""incident"" early on that taints everything that much worse.  Maybe it's the overwhelming sensation, even more so than in Redemption Island, that aspects of casting and other production things were designed to try to lead a specific player to victory.  Maybe it's that the editing is even more painful and the cast even more deplorable, at least in my opinion.  I really couldn't say.

But when I think of Redemption Island I mostly just sigh and shake my head, and when I think of Caramoan I cringe and recoil and dream only of death.  These two seasons overwhelmingly deserve to be the bottom two, so I'm fine with the current status quo, but if I had to pick one of the two that I got to wipe from history it would probably be Caramoan.",25

26.0,Caramoan,cy6ivm0,"Here's an exercise to replicate how bad Caramoan is:

One of these nights, have a few beers, and then have a few more. Really get loaded. Then sit down at your laptop and open a word document. Start typing out a fictional season of Survivor from off the top of your head. Pound the keyboard. Don’t stop, don’t look back at what you’ve got. Just write. Go through the whole night until you’ve finished the entire season. Then don’t edit a word. Print it out, give it to a friend, and tell them, “Here it is, give it a read.”

Caramoan is first-draft drunken fan fiction.

It is Survivor’s worst edited season. The overall narrative makes no sense. Characters portrayed as bullies in the pre-merge become lovable heroes in the post-merge. Characters portrayed as strategic forces in the pre-merge become hapless pawns after the merge. Certain popular returnees receive basically no screen time. 

Producers fucked up all over the place. Unpopular players from previous seasons are bafflingly brought back and then forced down the viewers’ throats. At one point this leads to the most uncomfortable moment in Survivor’s history since All-Stars. And that moment is just one part of an abysmal pre-merge that is awkward, unfun, and frustrating. The post-merge pretty much follows suit.

Also: entire situations are contrived by production to further a narrative the show prefers (especially the first boot). There is legitimate speculation that certain challenges and advantages post-merge were included specifically to benefit whom production wanted to win. Speaking of which, the winner is telegraphed from the first episode. They cakewalk to victory through the least amount of opposition any winner has ever faced. 

Caramoan has Survivor’s worst pre-merge, worst overall cast, worst F3, worst narrative, and a bottom-tier winner. There is one exciting tribal, and FTC is entertainingly bitter. Otherwise, nothing about Caramoan is interesting, and nothing is suspenseful. This season belongs in the bottom five. Feel free to skip it.",60
26.0,Caramoan,cy6nsz8,"Horrible choice of returnees and even more horrible editing. Character arcs are all over the place, with some oscillating randomly between hero and villain, some obnoxious production favorites being forced down your throat, and pretty much everyone else is completely invisible. It does have some fans for its number of blindsides and idol usage, but as a coherent story with good characters, it’s bottom of the barrel. 

Jacare's rank: #30/31",10
26.0,Caramoan,cy75ivz,"This season was doomed once they announced the cast. The ""fans"" were boring - and many weren't even fans. The tribe was at least 50% recruits. And the ""favorites"" weren't favorites. 6 of the 10 returnees hail from two of the least popular seasons of all time. They picked people because they were ""big"" characters, not because they were popular ones. This included a character that no one wanted to see again and a contestant that they absolutely should never have brought back and really just ended up being an exploitation of mental illness. Too many narratives that they tried to force and a winner that they've tried to make the fans like more than anyone actually does.

There's one tribal council in here that is a bright spot to me, but the rest of the season just feels like really awful fanfiction of the worst era of Survivor.

This is the only season that made me cry, but make sure you watch a couple of seasons the favourites came from (16,17,21,22,23,25) if you want to see this one.

*Tier: Bottom*

----

**Cast:** This is a fans vs. favorites season but don't let that fool you in any way. The favorite tribe is half popular characters and half poor decisions nobody would classify as popular. The fans tribe is also a misnomer, as a few of these individuals haven't seen an episode to save their life. Not only that but the fans are by and large unlikable and boring. An astoundingly poor cast considering half are returning players.

**Twists**: Nothing big is thrown in there, unless you count an impromptu tribal council at camp because of the instability of one player. Yeah... On second thought, maybe the horrible horrible reunion with only jury-onward players on-stage counts as well.

**Shining Light:** There is a single exciting tribal council that's pretty cool, I must admit. The post-merge is much better than the pre-merge, but the pre-merge is so bad that thats not saying much at all.

**You Should Watch If:** You're desperate for some survivor. You don't give a shit about editing. You somehow actually liked the majority of the favorites on the fav tribe. You're being paid to.

Gods, *no.* Could honestly beat out RI as my all-time least favorite. The edit is so disjointed and horrible: almost all of the time is spent on obnoxious characters being shoved down your throats, you're beaten over the head with one forced fan favorite in the post-merge whether you like them or not, and the contestants who *aren't* given these major caricatured edits are *almost invariably* made into totally neutral gamebots, given completely random storylines that change erratically with 0 explanation, or just simply ignored. (Or multiple at once, in some cases!)

Has some really uncomfortable moments, some really contrived moments, awful storytelling... just *blaaaah.* It's everything that can be bad about a modern or post-modern Survivor season rolled into one.

*Tier: Bottom*

----

**Cast:** The majority of the cast is underwhelming, underdeveloped, or unlikable. Lots of sheep, lots and lots of foolish sheep led to the slaughter. The returning players are far and away the focus of the bunch, but even they contribute to the season in a negative fashion.

**Twists**: Redemption Island makes its debut, one of the worst twists ever utilized. It essentially drains valuable time away from each episode, and amounts to very little. Now voting a player out isn't enough, they need to lose a challenge too! Dumb, dumb, dumb.

**Shining Light:** Some might find moments funny, but others will find those moments horrible and cringe-inducing. Some might think the winner's arc is interesting to watch play out, others would rather pretend the season never happened. You may get something out of this, but not much.

**You Should Watch If:** You've seen every other season and need more survivor. You are a huge fan of the returning players (even then it's iffy). You are a sadomasochist. You want to prepare for watching Caramoan. You often disagree with the majority's opinions on survivor. You are forced at gun point.

**One Word:** Rigged

I always appreciate this going back and rewatching it after Survivor Generic Deserted Island 26 has aired and the rewards and locations start to bleed together.

Casting is spot-on. Nearly every personality is big in the best possible way. The editing is fairly close to being balanced, with multiple people to root for and against. And even the ""villains"" take it in good stride, with them being more villains due circumstance as opposed to in other seasons where they're legitimately bad people. Strategy lovers will find portions of this season to their liking, as will those who watch it for the characters. Survival elements do play a minor role, too, particularly early on.

Every single one of them fills their role incredibly well, and every single one of them feels like an important part of the season — something practically unheard of from any season after the first 3 or 4. It’s just a collection of interesting people doing interesting things and interacting in fun ways. The location and integration with the culture is the best Survivor has ever done. One nighttime challenge requires the players to create a Chinese fireworks display, and later some of them go to the Great Wall of China and the Shaolin Temple — I mean, how freaking cool is that?? I feel like I should rank this season even higher than I do. If you don’t want to start with Borneo, this is definitely the best choice as the perfect blend of old style and new style. It isn’t too complicated strategically (but it isn’t too stagnant, either — there are definitely some shakeups and unpredictable moments), it’s just a brilliant collection of characters with a balanced edit and very satisfying winner.

I do, however, think most other seasons have a little bit more to make them stand out from others - but again, there's really nothing *bad* here, either, and there's a well-rounded assortment of good. So it's sort of like **a sample platter of all of what Survivor has to offer: it may not provide the most of any one thing, but it provides some of everything,** and it can let you decide what main course you want next. (And most people rank it much higher than I do or even have it among their all-time favorites. So when I say it doesn't excel at anything, that doesn't mean it doesn't stand out as an overall product.)

...However, one problem with starting here (which isn't a problem for the actual season, so it's often forgotten) is that China explicitly spoils a moment from Pearl Islands that's widely considered one of the greatest and most shocking moments in the entire history of the show, or even the single best. A contestant references it very directly in a confessional. Considering that a significant number of viewers consider this the *best Survivor moment ever*, I think it's worth pointing out. But I still don't think it's the *best* move to start with Pearl Islands. I already lean towards Gabon as a better starting point, but I especially recommend that when this season directly references an all-time great Survivor moment.

**My Personal Ranking:** 15/31

**Overall verdict:** Well-rounded season that's good at everything and bad at nothing. **If you're going to start with modern Survivor** (which, again, not really my recommendation because that's just sort of ignoring years and years of the show - but *if!* you disagree with me there), then **this or Gabon** is the best place to start. It has no glaring weaknesses and manages to simultaneously feel more old-school than anything since Palau *and* more modern than anything that came before it, so even if it is not absolutely outstanding all the time, it is a great exhibition of what the show has to offer. Definitely a better starting point than Cagayan.",5

I don't know why people care so hard about this, the foundation of Survivor comes from great characters with interpersonal conflicts living together. China is that kind of season with it's entertaining cast of jerks. And so what if the cast don't spend 20 minutes solving who & how someone should get voted out each episode. That's for a different season.  
China is one of those seasons that's always been stationary in it's legacy. All Survivor fans have seen it and the consensus reached is usually the same. China is one of a kind.",2
15.0,China,d3oz6bu,"I'm currently watching all seasons chronologically. This is my review just after seeing S15.

It's interesting to see this ranked so high on this listing, and even more interesting seeing the reasons behind it. This season absolutely was exceptional, absolutely above average. But nothing certain really stood out to me specifically, except maybe the location. 

The cast to me was just alright. There were a handful of survivors I really, really enjoyed, but there were a lot of survivors I wasn't a big fan of, and some of them lasted longer than I would've hoped for. 

The gameplay was pretty one sided. Some people played old-school, and some played much more strategically oriented, which gave for some nerve-wracking moments, as you never know if the players are going to respond the same as you, or the opposite of you. 

With these minor complaints out of the way, this season seemed to have moments, big or small, in every single episode, which made the season enjoyable the whole way through. Without spoiling anything specific, the cast seemed to change their minds constantly, and always kept you on your toes. I never really felt like anything was filler, and was one of the seasons I easily could've watched in one sitting. 

While I don't think it's the end-all be-all season, it was very entertaining.",2
15.0,China,d3jhqan,"I have always, and barring some new amazing season, will always recommend China as the place to start when watching Survivor.  It perfectly combines everything that makes survivor great:  

A fantastic location - I can't really do it justice with words but it's unique and refreshingly different from all the other seasons  
A great cast - Cannot stress this point enough: China has the best cast of any season, and it's not particularly close.  There isn't a single cast member I'm disappointed with, which isn't true of any other season.  
A mix of strategy - While strategy isn't as prevalent in China as in some other seasons, when it does come up it's always interesting.  If China doesn't end up being your first season, you can still enjoy the turning point in strategy that it is (you can see the beginnings of the turn towards new school Survivor strategy in China while still seeing old school strategy in effect as well).

15.0,China,d3jnpxu,"From last time: 

>China is my personal favorite season and, IMO, a great starter season for new viewers.

>As the 15th season, China falls in the middle of the current Survivor canon, and it is a really excellent blend of ""old"" and ""new"" school, showcasing many of the games newer mechanics, such as Hidden Immunity Idols, in a way that is easy for a new viewer to understand. The game has enough zigs and zags to keep things unpredictable without the progression of the game ever becoming convoluted or  hard to follow. It also manages to keep the ""old school"" charm, thanks to an exceptional 16 person cast--a shoe in for the Best Cast Ever. All of China's castaways have distinct, unique characterizations and roles to play in the story, which makes identifying and learning the players easy and uncomplicated. A lot of the conflict in the game is also fueled by the difficulty of the conditions and the reality of daily survival.

>Not only does this season blend the elements of old and new well, but because it exposes viewers to both, it can give you an idea of what Survivor has to offer and how invested you may want to become with the show. I would recommend Survivor: China to *anyone* who likes great TV.

China's cast may be the best crop of new players in a Survivor season ever. It's a delightful mix of gamers, physical threats, beauties, heroes, villains, and funny characters. While I will admit it's not the best location, the season does a great job incorporating the Chinese theme. There are interesting wrinkles that production pulls off, some work great and a few not so much. And arguably the best final tribal council performance by a player ever. If you enjoy the mix of ""old-school"" and ""new-school"" Survivor, you'll enjoy China.",1
15.0,China,d3lpc6b,"Best setting and use of culture, by far.  The season balanced the characters and strategy so well.  This led to a lot of good drama, not Worlds Apart drama, and every episode from ""DAYUM!"" to biting the apple to the finale had its share of great moments. ",1
15.0,China,d3lwspx,"Hoo boy, China....

This season is astounding. It is the perfect balance of new school Survivor and old school Survivor. The culture is beautifully integrated into the season, and the casting was great overall. 

Honestly, when most people ask why China is so great, it mostly comes down to the casting. Each person is memorable in their own way, and they all provide something to contribute. Several of these players have returned for future seasons. 

While the strategy isn't necessarily unpredictable, the game overall is fun to watch. With epic culture, epic characters, and overall an epic location, China is a great way to get into the show.

18.0,Tocantins,d3j2qly,"I'm surprised this season hasn't received more attention yet from the posters here. It's an old-school season with 16 players, two tribes, and very few twists outside of Exile Island (not to be confused with the much worse Redemption Island), here for its final appearance until Season 29.

Casting was really good. We've had four returnees from it (two of whom have come back twice), which is a really high number for one of the middle seasons. In addition, two or three more players probably deserve to come back as well. The location is inland (always a plus), the challenges are interesting, and while everybody is obviously playing the game, they all seem to be having a good time too. I can't stress how important this is.

It's not perfect (there's not as much strategy as other seasons), and one cast member in particular is a big hit or miss with peoplee, but it's a good solid season to watch with memorable personalities that has a big impact on the show's greater metagame. The winner had probably one of the most well-rounded games ever. 

Tocantins is also probably the end of an era, and a good way to close out Survivor's sometimes-weird, sometimes-meandering, sometimes-great 2004-2009 stretch. The very last episode in which Exile Island is featured (until Season 29) is a particular highlight. After this comes Samoa, and a very different kind of gameplay and editing focus.",25
18.0,Tocantins,d3j2ppr,"Lots of people on this sub absolutely adore this season. While I don’t really agree with it being in the top tier, I do think it’s a pretty refreshing season, with only 16 players and a generally more classic feel. There’s one really bizarre editing choice in the premerge that still makes no sense to me, but other than that, there’s not a whole lot to dislike about it. Has one absolutely incredible character and some pretty good background ones as well. I’m not a huge fan of the winner and find them to be pretty bland, so maybe that’s part of why I don’t like this season as much as some people, but overall it’s a pretty solid, agreeable all-around season in an absolutely stunning location. Not a bad choice for a starter season, although I think China does it better.

18.0,Tocantins,d3jayai,"Tocantins is an interesting one. In most fan circles I visit, its reception is pretty lukewarm; some people dislike it and find it boring, some quite like it, most think it was just kind of decent. But here, people *freaking love Tocantins.* I don't really know what about it makes it more popular here than elsewhere, or what about /r/survivor makes them like it more.

I think it's a pretty agreeable season, though, with not many underedited contestants, a largely old-school format, a very satisfying boot order and winner/F2, and lots of good characters. I really don't have any distinct complaints about it, but I also think that **almost everything it does right, lots of other seasons do better,** while also doing more strong things of their own. **It isn't bad in any way, but I don't think it's enough of a standout to be worth a *super* early viewing.**

I especially would avoid it *first* because one contestant in particular is... so weird and *so* unlike anyone or anything on most other seasons. I mean, he's fucking awesome. You will know who I'm talking about by the final 8 at the latest. He is an absolute fucking gem of a Survivor character. I adore him. Buuuut, for the purposes of *this* thread? He's also not a great representation of or introduction to the show.

If you're interested in watching more modern ones, Tocantins is maybe a good, like, third or fourth season to check out or something, to get you more into the show before seeing better seasons. But I wouldn't start with it.

**My Personal Ranking:** 19/31, but I can't really remember why I liked it less on my most recent viewing, and I loved it at the time, so I'll probably rewatch it soonish and see whether it should rank higher.

**Overall verdict:** Fun, agreeable season. A little weird in some aspects and too lacking in standout aspects to be the *first* season you watch, but it could be a good early pick if you're starting with modern ones and don't want to just binge all the super great ones right away.",3

In addition this season is casted super well, and it may be the cast with the highest floor.  Every cast member serves a purpose, from the first boot to the winner.

Islands",d3izn3f,"Pearl Islands is very nearly flawless and ages incredibly well, especially when contrasted with Amazon. It zooms out of the gate with a unique opening that hasn't been done before or since, and serves to establish several characters and overarching themes. At times, the storylines seem rather basic: *root for these guys, root against these guys* but upon closer examination things are much more nuanced. Who's the true hero in this situation? Is this tribe the villain tribe or are they tragic figures? How outrageously over-the-top can one contestant get and should that behavior be rewarded?

After several twists and turns with moments alternating from shocking to tragic to heroic, legends are born. Pearl Islands has staying power, with four players returning over the years in five separate seasons. 

The flaws: There are two major ones. First is an extremely controversial twist, one of the biggest in show history, midway through the game. Second is that Final Tribal isn't the true climax of the season.

*  It's brilliant. This is the only season of Survivor where I often forget I'm watching a reality show. It feels like it was written. The pacing is amazing and each episode feels like an important chapter for the entire story. A real enigma of a reality show season that flows effortlessly.   
*  All the characters are awesome and have a story. People miss the point when they complain it's the [Rupert](/spoiler) season. It's not. There's a lot more to chew on in this season than him.  
*  It's the 7th season, yet it's just as, if not more, important to Survivor lore than Borneo and Australian Outback.  
* The bad twist only made it more epic.  
*  The pirate theme invades every facet of the season in a welcome way and brings a certain energy that hasn't been replicated since.  
*  The location is my favourite and the most relaxing to look at. There's a calm deep blue feeling to it all and not overly paradise-ish. The type of islands you'd probably shipwreck on. Wink.  
*  Best premiere of any season. It's the perfect foundation for the rest of the story.  
*  It feels like an adventure. More-so than any other season. There's always something interesting happening.  
*  One of the strongest challenge catalogues.  
*  Unbelievably quotable.  

It's the whole package. You can't ask for any more from a season. I can't think of a single thing I would change, everything that should of happened did. Pearl islands is the most epic, entertaining and complete story Survivor has told.",9
7.0,"Pearl
Islands",d3jalf8,"What I always love to say about Pearl Islands is this: I think that, before Pearl Islands began, the 16 players and all the producers sat down together, said ""Let's make the best damn season that ever was or ever will be. Let's blow this one out of the fucking park"", and succeeded even beyond their own wildest dreams.

Most of the time, I'll explain my opinions super in-depth. But sometimes, absolutely nothing that I or anyone else could ever say could possibly compare to the thing itself. Pearl Islands, the pinnacle of Survivor, is one such time. You could not write a better Survivor season than Pearl Islands. You could not even write Pearl Islands, or people would tell you to fuck off with something that unrealistic.

So I'm not even going to elaborate. I'm not going to say one word about what makes Pearl Islands so great. Just watch it. Go into it knowing as little as you can, and bask in the overwhelming wonder and beauty and perfection that is almost unequivocally Survivor's greatest season.

*(That said, I don't think it should be your first one. Even outside of chronology, I think starting with Pearl Islands is a pretttttty bad idea. A lot of its biggest moments will pack a much harder punch if you realize just how unorthodox they are. I know that the hype makes it tempting, but don't just dive into this one.)*

7.0,"Pearl
Islands",d3j2a6w,"There’s really not much to say about Pearl Islands that hasn’t already been said. There’s a reason that it’s pretty much universally considered to be the greatest of all time. This season hits the ground running with a fantastic premiere, where we’re introduced to some of the most memorable characters ever. We have the prototype for hero and villain, one of the Internet’s all-time favorites, and countless strong members of the supporting cast. The story is freaking amazing, and it will leave you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end both before and after the merge — something very few other seasons can attest to. Contains one particular episode that really sends it into the stratosphere — and the best part is, 3 different people can read that last sentence and come to 3 different conclusions on what episode I’m talking about!! Shit gets INTENSE in this season. The players are playing hard, some are playing well, some aren’t playing so well. But you do really get invested in it. If my life depended on getting someone into Survivor with just one season, this would be my choice, and if you’re unsure if you really want to get into the show and just want to check out a season or two and see if it hooks you, this would absolutely be my pick, although I would still recommend starting with Borneo in most cases.

Now the season does have a big twist that some people don't like/consider unfair. Personally, I LOVE the twist, mainly because I think the season would've been significantly worse off without it. But it does cause some people to shy away from calling it the best. But still, it's pretty much universally considered the best for a reason. The editing is amazing. The storytelling is amazing. The theme is amazing. The challenges are amazing. The location is amazing. Pearl Islands is amazing. Go watch it.

7.0,"Pearl
Islands",d3luslj,"Continuing from my Amazon review, it is the appetizer for a much better season, PEARL ISLANDS BABY! 

Pearl Islands was the first season I ever watched, and I was sure in for a treat. The premiere on its own gets you really amped for the game- the players go in with the clothes on their backs, and they have to buy supplies in a village. This season is based on a pirate theme, and they really go to town with it. 

This season provides us with some of the most memorable characters the show has ever had. We got the memorable pirate Rupert, who, while a broken base nowadays, was beloved by the audience for his over the top antics. No one like Rupert has ever appeared on Survivor before. And on the other side of the coin, you got Jonny Fairplay, who was the biggest Survivor villain before Russell Hantz reared his ugly bald head. 

There is one big flaw, midway through the game, there is a twist that remains controversial to this day. 

With unpredictability, great theme, and great characters, and a great winner, Pearl Islands is an **excellent** way to hook someone into the show. It sure worked for me.

Philippines was my favorite post-HvV season until Kaoh Rong came around. The first few episodes are fucking fantastic, with some of the most raw and emotional moments the show has given us in years, and you really get attached to one group of players in particular. Later on, the season is filled with great heroes, villains, and everything in between. I’m usually not a fan of seasons with 2 or 3 returnees, but this season nailed it down very well; the choices all came in with something to prove and were chosen for the right reasons, and here, they are part of the story, not THE story. Some great tribal councils, unpredictability, and a solid cast, I can’t say anything bad here except the editing becomes slightly lopsided later on (and it’s still a godsend compared to the seasons around it).

Finally, *finally*, we were given a good cast, and the result was the most balanced and enjoyable season in years.

Philippines has several mini-arcs that overall encapsulates the season quite well. The first of these mini-arcs culminates with one of the darker episodes in the show's history (in a good way). The others set the board for the chaotic post-merge, which is one of the best. Editing, while not as balanced as it was in the early seasons, is still quite good here with in-depth personalities and motivations.

Philippines was SO FUCKING AWESOME to watch live after 22-24. On the rewatch, though, it did go down for me a bit - the first four episodes are so, SO good, but I think it loses a lot of steam after that, and I think the post-merge should have been edited waaaay differently.

In any case, though, don't start with this one, because it has maaajor spoilers for previous seasons, and some of its big stories are more satisfying when you know who those players are. And even without that factor, I think many other seasons manage to do the same things right that this season did while also doing less wrong. It was fantastic live but there's no real reason to start here or, when other seasons hit its strengths better without any of its flaws, to watch it particularly early.

**My Personal Ranking:** 16/31

**Overall verdict:** Solid season that's worth watching, but I think it's better right after 22-24.

28.0,Cagayan,d3jelre,"I'm a fan of Cagayan. I think it has potentially THE best premiere of all time, especially thanks to it being a two-parter that focuses on one of the all-time most dysfunctional tribes ever. The rest of the pre-merge is incredibly fun to me too, and the cast is just really fun to watch. After an amazing merge episode, it seems to be a common opinion that things kind of peter out for a while until about the finale, and I agree - there's a pretty big, unbalanced focus on two specific contestants, and there's a twist that I'm REALLY not a fan of. But even then, I think there are *some* great moments hidden in those post-merge episodes, and the finale is also great and ends the season on a high note, so the stretch of weak middle episodes isn't quite as awful as it could be. It's all very modern Survivor-y, and I wouldn't say to watch it first but I did watch it while it was airing with someone who hadn't ever seen Survivor before, and she proceeded to binge-watch a couple more seasons after being hooked on Cagayan. So I think it could work, even if a lot of the events and twists here are pretty unusual for Survivor. 

Oh, and this season also contains one of my top 3 favorite contestants ever [(a certain Mrs. Colby Donaldson)](/spoiler). A very... polarizing figure, to say the least, but someone whose mere presence just made the season so much better. ",11

Thought it could rank as high as my top ten before the rewatch, and now it is hardly in my top twenty. The premiere is amazing, the merge episode is great, and the section in between them averages out to be decent. Thennnn it absolutely tanks. When I look at all the individual episodes, I don't get the hype here at all. With something like Cambodia, I can get why people like it more than I do if they're watching for different things, and I can get that for *some* of the episodes here, but for the most part I don't understand it.

Anyhoo, like I said, wouldn't start here. **I don't think any overall aspect of this season stands out compared to other seasons, and it has a lot more weaknesses**: there are some great moments, but it has an *awful* twist, some lame editing, and a reaaally dead streak in the post-merge.

I also wouldn't recommend it because **it's almost as modern as modern Survivor gets and very misleading about what the show has to offer**, so if you are not going chronologically, you'd be better served starting with a Gabon or a China that *blends* newer and older stuff - and I also think the particular game and edit of this winner are sort of misleading about what traits are typically rewarded.

Has some way dull stretches, too many forgettable contestants, regrettable twists, an anomalous winner, a blatant spoiler for the winner of Nicaragua, and generally is *so* ""modern"" (which is not the same thing as ""good"" and ""exciting"") that it really misrepresents the show. Plenty of reasons not to start here. If you don't plan on watching almost any previous seasons then I guess you can start here, but if you want to be a serious fan, definitely one of the worse starting points.

SJDS and especially Kaoh Rong manage to do what people say this season does right while not really falling into any of its same mistakes. SJDS has the blood vs. water twist that may make it a weird starting point, so I'd definitely suggest Kaoh Rong as a direct alternative.

**My Personal Ranking:** 20/31

**Overall verdict:** Some decent characters and a strong pre-merge make it an okay viewing experience overall, but too much dead space and too regrettable a central post-merge twist to be anywhere close to one of the better seasons in the show's run, and would make for a very misleading introduction to a new viewer.

28.0,Cagayan,d3jr2wg,"Following Survivor's incredible 10th Anniversary celebration season, *Heroes vs Villains,* Survivor's producers fell into a hard rut as they attempted to re-create the successes of HvV by leaning hard on returning players and game-changing twists. The resulting ""Dark Era"" is considered by most fans to be some of the worst stretch of seasons in Survivor history (Particularly 22-26 with 25 being the major anomaly). 

What Survivor needed was a season to prove that a cast without returning players could be just as riveting, if not more so, than an All-Stars season, and thankfully Survivor: Cagayan came along to save the series when it did. This season features the return of the three-tribe format, breaking the contestant into three teams based on the core attributes they (supposedly) rely on in the game and in life: Brains, Brawn and Beauty. 

A strong cast of players manages to pull Cagayan through even it's slow moments. There is someone for everybody to root for in this game and while eventually some characters begin to overshadow others, this is a season where ultimately nobody is left totally irrelevant to the narrative. Everyone has their own story, no matter how big or how small.

Cagayan has hooked a *lot* of new viewers on Survivor, so if you've finally decided to bite the bullet and check it out, Cagayan is absolutely a solid starting point. 

My one warning would be that Cagayan is decidedly a **modern season.** It takes place in a time period where the game is developed and understood and people are raring to go, and while this is not some un-developed season of nobodies, the strategy definitely takes precedence over the story and characters. **If you are looking to start with a season that has a broader focus on both ""old"" and ""new"" school elements in order to learn more about the show and figure out what about Survivor most appeals to you, I would recommend starting a little further back than here.** In particular, I think viewing Cagayan first can put you at risk of poisoning your own well, so to speak, as seasons that don't match it's frenetic pace may set unrealistic expectations for most other seasons, particularly early ones.

But I think parts of it are very misleading about what Survivor is about, ESPECIALLY in regards to the winner. Additionally, it’s very new-school in the sense that the game is so developed; there’s lots of talk of vote splits and idols and strategy that might seem very complex to a new viewer. Just as importantly, if someone starts with this season first, they will likely get accustomed to it and expect every season to be just as hyperactive and strategy-based (and I bring this up because I figure it is going to place very high on this list, and is often recommended when people ask which season to watch). I think China and Kaoh Rong do a much better job of combining old-school principles with new-school editing styles.

As for my options on Cagayan itself… the premerge was fantastic with one of the greatest trainwrecks of a tribe of all time, lots of memorable voteoffs, good character moments and just tons of hilarious stuff in general. It also has one of the best casts of the last 5 or so years. After the merge, however, the editing really takes a sharp turn, shifting the main focus onto talk of BIG MOVES and highlighting two players; one of whom I like as a personality, but am not a fan of parts of the their story, and the other who has tons of huge fans and tons of huge haters who I don’t really care about either way. So when those are the two biggest characters, I can’t really get into the postmerge as much. Also, one postmerge twist is just absolutely horrendous and never, ever should have happened. Still, it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end, and if you love strategy talk and the two aforementioned characters, it will probably wind up in your top 5. As it is, I think it’s a pretty fun season, but not one of the best, and not a very good starting point.

Villains",d3j0xci,"This is an all-star season of returning players from 2-19, so don't watch if you care about spoilers, including past winners, past relationships, and past alliances.

That said, if you *don't* care about spoilers, Heroes vs Villains is one of the most popular seasons ever and definitely one that will get you hooked. It was my second season, personally, and by the time the credits rolled I knew I was going to be a Survivor fan for life.

Some of the reasons I love it -

- The challenges are very intense and physically brutal. If you want to see players going *hard* at one another, this is the season for you. It's filled with injuries, people overcoming injuries, intense physical contact, occasional near-brawling. It's insane. Everyone is there to win and it shows.

- The strategy side of things is equally hardcore. Betrayals, blindsides, voting clusterfucks, constantly-shifting alliances. There are crazy eliminations left and right.

- There are several epic moments in this season that actually went down in Survivor history for being so nuts. If you google things like ""best moments in Survivor"" and ""top shockers in Survivor,"" Heroes vs Villains is always on the list, usually at the top.

- There's continued controversy, even to this day, about which of the final three deserved to win. Just bringing up the subject will start debate. It's a strong endgame that will leave you with a lot to consider.

- Once you go back and see the earlier seasons of Survivor, you can rewatch Heroes vs Villains and pick up on all the things you missed before. Some players tarnish their legacy with HvV; others become immortal; others bridge or close their ""arcs"" that span multiple seasons. This is the main reason people tell you not to watch an all-star season first, because it's like eating your dessert before your dinner, but fuck the system! You do what you want!

So yeah. As long as you understand that Heroes vs Villains is 100% spoilery for what came before it, I say it's fine to watch even as a newbie. It's Survivor at its peak.",28

That being said, of Survivor's three All-Star seasons, this one is the personal favorite of many in the fandom. It's an absolute riot and stellar ride from start to finish and is everything an explosive 10th anniversary All-Star extravaganza should be. This is widely considered one of the best seasons overall, which can make it very tempting to jump into it early.

**Rank 4/32**",3
20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",d3jazpw,"**MAJOR RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!**

Fun season that I rank relatively high. I don't revere it as the awesome godly standout some people do, but I still think it's really fun, so I rank it pretty high.

**BUT!:** The things that I rank it high for are largely the continuations of previous seasons' storylines. This season just will not be nearly as enjoyable if you haven't seen previous seasons to know who these contestants actually are. The best parts of this season are *specifically* where it follows the journeys of its contestants from their previous appearances.

To fully familiarize yourself with this cast, I think you need to watch seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (1 and 3 aren't represented here, but they definitely are *majorly* represented in S8 All-Stars, which is probably a must-view before this one), 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19. If you don't, you'll be missing out on a lot of stuff this season AND getting spoiled on those past seasons' outcomes.

And I don't think it's some utterly fantastic orgasmic viewing you should rush into anyway. I think that it's a very fun and satisfying season, but that there *are* more fun and satisfying ones.

But mostly, returning players out the wazoo, spoilers out the wazoo's wazoo, so don't start here.

If you really, *really* want to watch this one early, though, I'd say it **especially spoils Palau.** If you're only watching a few seasons before it - which I really don't recommend, but if you're sold on that for whatever reason - I would say check out Palau first. This season spoils a lot, but I think its Palau spoilers probably take away the most from an unspoiled viewing.

**My Personal Ranking:** 10/31, though 10-12 are all very close.

**Overall verdict:** Solid, entertaining Survivor, but because *all of its cast are returning players* and those previous reputations and relationships do play MAJORLY into the dynamics and stories of this season, you **shouldn't watch it early at all.** You will get less out of it while also getting strongly spoiled on a bunch of previous seasons at once.",4
20.0,"Heroes vs.

I feel like this can also be said with other strat-heavy seasons like *Cambodia*.

The winner is amazing, however, and a lot of history is made in the season.",2
20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",d3jq6yc,"It's an iconic season of Survivor mainly because it's the first true all-star season to get things right, and has a ton of fun moments if you like the returnees that are in it. That being said, on its own, it doesn't stand out too much to me as particularly impressive.",2
20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",d3jugqr,"*Heroes vs. Villains* is one of those rare seasons that lives up to the hype. It manages to balance characters, strategy, and surprising moments in a way that works far better than it has any right to. it does have a bit of a weird edit in parts (some characters are overused, others are underused), but it works in spite of that.

That said, **do not make *Heroes vs. Villains* your first season. Or even your second season.** It's a season that benefits heavily from knowing the past seasons of the people involved; some seasons are more ""essential"" than others, but you really will want to have watched a good amount of the prior seasons.

In particular, you'll get the most out of this season if you've watched *The Australian Outback*, *Pearl Islands*, *All-Stars*, *Palau*, *Cook Islands*, *China*, *Micronesia*, *Tocantins*, and *Samoa*. *Marquesas*, *Guatemala*, *Panama*, and *Gabon* (as well as the pre-*All-Stars* seasons) aren't essential preparatory viewing, though they don't hurt.",2
20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",d3j2v99,"**It has been stated several times already, but let me reiterate: no matter what anyone says, do not watch this season first. So much of its appeal depends on knowing the returning players and their stories in advance. The returnees originally come from seasons 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19, and many of them that make their third appearance here are more notable for their second appearance in either 8 or 16,
 so I would strongly recommend watching those as well.**

An immensely popular season at the time and up to today, Heroes vs Villains is pretty much what you’d expect out of an all returnee season. The fireworks fly both before and after the merge, with some of the most memorable moments, conflicts and strategic decisions ever made. Personally, I like it way less than most people; I’m not a big fan of the boot order on either side, a lot of the people I was most excited to see back are underedited, and I find the player who gets the most airtime to be absolutely insufferable. But there’s enough going on around that player to enjoy the season as a whole, and even as someone who likes it less than just about everyone, I’d still say it has countless fun stuff going on from beginning to end. For the love of god though, just don’t watch it first.

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,d3j3e9u,"Just finished up a few days ago, so I predict its placement could be affected by recency bias, but I still really, really loved this season and it’s easily my favorite of the past 7 years. This is primarily due to its incredibly strong cast, with absolutely nobody feeling neglected or pointless and everyone feeling like they are part of the story in a way no season in the past ~5 years has been able to do. The characters are very humanized; some deal with moral conflicts, others with insecurities, others with pure arrogance. Has some great heroes, great villains, and everything in between. It’s also a pretty funny season, thanks to the cast’s wide selection of good narrators, and the difficulty of the elements provide for some of the most memorable sendoffs the show has seen in years. Some people aren’t a fan of the season’s winner, but I would definitely recommend this season to a new viewer over Cagayan BECAUSE of the winner, since the way their story was told more accurately reflects what the show is about in a subtle, yet effective matter. There really aren’t many major flaws I can think of outside of one stupid late-game twist, and it has something that just about any fan of the show can enjoy. If you insist on starting with a modern season, this is absolutely my pick.

Everyone got a decently fleshed-out edit, and I felt like I got to know the contestants as people. Even the villains got two-dimensional edits that showed who they were as humans outside of the game, which is impressive after so many seasons of villainous caricatures. Also contains some really funny moments, some GREAT contestants/narrators, and some genuinely heartbreaking scenes thanks to the horrible conditions. If you want to get into modern Survivor, this is probably one of the first seasons to watch (except maybe watch Cagayan before it for a number of reasons). ",7
32.0,Kaôh Rōng,d3jb5k8,"Kaoh Rong, along with Gabon and China, is one of the seasons that I think is an excellent mixture of new and old Survivor. It's one of the most well-rounded seasons ever, maybe even more than SJDS. It's incredibly strategically dynamic as you'd hope for from a modern season, but it has some fantastic character-driven stories like an old-school season. It has humor, it has emotional drama, it has a magnificent focus on the elements. This season really has everything good you can want in a Survivor season.

One problem is it outright spoils the winner of Cagayan... and that season, in turn, spoils the winner of Nicaragua. I think that KR's spoil of Cagayan is less big of a deal than Cag's spoiler of Nicaragua or China's spoiler of Pearl Islands. It sucks that any of them are things that exist, but with how Cagayan operates as a season, I think this is a *relatively* less bad spoiler. Still, it's definitely a reason to maybe not start with this season, which is unfortunate because otherwise it is an incredibly strong, consistent, solid season all-around. If you don't mind that *one* spoiler of a previous winner, this is the absolute best modern season to start with.

**My Personal Ranking:** 17/31, but it was much higher - probably around #9 or #10 - before the finale, which has one twist I happen to hate and dock the season massively because of. It is still very strong overall and especially as an introduction, though.

Taking place in Kaoh Rong, Cambodia, this season features three tribes of six castaways each, repeating the ultra-popular tribal division process of Brains vs Brawn vs Beauty used in the series re-defining 28th season Cagayan. In this physically demanding season, each castaway is truly unique and no two players ever come off as interchangeable. Each player has their own story and characterization, no matter how big or small. In addition, this season has a little bit of everything: strategy and gamplay; character and story; humor; drama; emotional highs and lows; survival against the elements; and survival against the game.

As a very modern season, there are a few twists that occur that are variants on past twists, which may make older seasons a better starting point. However, in terms of being a platter that has a little something to offer everyone, Kaoh Rong is a season that I believe will stand the test of time and will likely age as a modern classic.

I too haaate the jury twist (and adore Pearl Islands), but given the circumstances I really can't see why the jury twist as it played out in Kaoh Rong should cause that dramatic a shift in your opinion.  Is it because you're worried they'll bring it back / make it a staple of the show?

Plus the way it was executed here gave us an incredibly weak finale where the reveal of who's in the F3 was an afterthought and the Final Immunity Challenge wasn't even a big deal because we had no idea it was the Final Immunity Challenge.

10.0,Palau,d3j2edw,"Palau is like a greek tragedy, but a really good greek tragedy. It isn’t a fun season. The players don’t seem to be enjoying themselves very often, the game takes a toll on some of them like no other season has done, and the ending is one of the darkest we have ever seen. But unlike All-Stars, all of this just serves to make the season better and more dramatic. It is truly one of a kind. Possibly the most iconic female hero of all time is in this season, as well as one of the most likable winners — who I’d say is a strong contender for best player ever. Saying more about why I love this season so much would be kind of spoilerery, so I’ll stop here. But if you haven’t seen it, watch it. Strategically, emotionally, and physically, this season is a doozy. And it’s pretty fucking compelling.

Rank: #3/32",28
10.0,Palau,d3jlgxa,"PALAU IS SO GOOD WATCH IT NOW

I loooooove Palau, I'm in agreement with jacare37 in just about every way on this season.  Unique, dark, compelling as can be.",9
10.0,Palau,d3izwme,An incredibly powerful season that explores the emotional consequences of playing Survivor like no other.There is no other season like Palau and there never will be again.It's absolutely brutal but brilliant television.,8
10.0,Palau,d3jer16,"**Grade** **A**

Palau is probably the most unique season in the show's history. While part of Survivor's 2nd generation (S9-S20), Palau I think is the last ""old-school"" season. As later seasons focus more on strategic gameplay, Palau is a great character-driven story that unfortunately gets lost in ""modern"" Survivor. A pre-merge that will likely never happen again, it's a season you have to watch for history's sake. Plus, Palau I believe has the *best* *challenges* *ever.* And while the season's winner may be obvious post merge, it's still gripping television nonetheless. 
",13
10.0,Palau,d3jmqaq,"Palau is a different season. Something here has never happened before, and likely never will again, and is definitely a dark season, much like the war theme may have suggested, and there are definitely many very emotionally developed characters, one who is probably my favourite male character ever. Even though I don't liove the winner, I have to admit, they are a great part of the season. Overall, a great season of Survivor., and I'd recommend it. It's also pretty neccessary to watch Guatemala. 

**Rank 5/32**",6
10.0,Palau,d3jf4by,"This season is really unique for a lot of reasons. Definitely one of the more emotional seasons, it has a dark tone all the way through and is capped perfectly at the end. One of the best stories that Survivor has told.


Rank: #12/32",5
10.0,Palau,d3jlklk,Palau is completely unique in Survivor's run sofar. It could have been written by an oscar nominated screenwriter; dramatic from start to finish. Which is literally also the dark side of this season. Definitely the left half of the ranking list but only for hardcore viewers not for a start.,5
10.0,Palau,d3jo805,"This season is insane. From the get-go there is a game-changing moment and this doesn't stop. Filled with firsts, this is a MUST WATCH season. With modern day twists this season will always be a one time thing, there is nothing like it. Also has some of the most likeable characters in Survivor history.",4
10.0,Palau,d3iztel,"In my opinion, one of the best Survivor seasons. It encompasses what I like about Survivor. A likeable cast, a good winner, a reason to keep watching per episode, a common theme for challenges, interactions with the cast, and the list goes on. 

It's also a dark season, not like All Stars kind of dark, but it isn't always a happy go fun season which is a nice break.",4
10.0,Palau,d3j5la1,"A really unique season that probably will never happen again. Good season to watch purely for that. Though I'm not sure if this should be your first season to watch since the storyline is exclusive to this season. The last third of the season gets quite darker and uncomfortable. Some people really like that, others including myself don't. ",4
10.0,Palau,d3k1gbm,"An absolutely remarkable end to Survivor’s first 10 seasons and my personal favorite season ever.   Palau has a ton of things going for it.

First of all it has a fantastic military theme that shows throughout the show.  Only Pearl Islands and China are comparable in terms of how much they stuck with the theme.  This leads to probably the best challenges throughout all of Survivor occurring in this season.  Every challenge is exciting to watch and you can feel the military vibes emanating throughout the cast while they’re performing in these challenges.  They are brutal, intense and absolutely thrilling to watch.  The theme also extends to the theme song and even the story of the season.

Second of all it has a really strong cast accentuated by an absolutely fantastic boot order.  Similar to Vanuatu and Borneo, most of the weak members of the cast leave fairly early, leading to an endgame of the strongest, most complex characters.  My personal favorite Survivor is on the cast and at least two others would be contenders for my top 30.  

Third, and most important of all for me, Palau has a great central story that is absolutely breathtaking to watch unfold.  All of its characters fit very nicely into an awesome, very real narrative, culminating in my favorite moment in all of Survivor history.  I’m having a really hard time talking about Palau without spoiling it but its central story is wonderful.

There are some understandable gripes people have with this season.  Palau is not a fun season to watch (though I contend it has more fun moments than people give it credit for, particularly pre-merge).  It is brutal and some parts of it are near uncomfortable to watch.  It also has one super bullshit twist that I enjoy but most people hate. 
	
I also wouldn’t recommend watching this first.  There are a lot of things that happen in Palau that need some context to fully appreciate this.  I would recommend this season to anybody who appreciates primarily the characters on Survivor, as it is truly top-notch when it comes to portraying its cast as human beings, rather than simply players like many modern seasons.  If you want a season that reminds you that the castaways on Survivor are real human beings, I’d say Palau is your best bet, as there is no cast that is portrayed quite as realistically as Palau’s (with a couple of exceptions). 

If you care about strategy there's some pretty good strategy in this season too.  This season features one of my contenders for best winners ever (it's between this one and the winners of Fiji, One World and Tocantins for me), and a number of players make really interesting moves.

I rank it 1/32, and it's not even close.",4
10.0,Palau,d3j2uv8,Greatest pre-merge of all time,3
10.0,Palau,d3j74jc,"This season makes a very huge first, and gets dark (in a good way) before the merge even hits. I'd say this season is well-regarded on the sub, and with good reason. ",3
10.0,Palau,d3jasc0,"Palau is a very hard season to discuss without spoiling. I don't want to risk spoiling anyone in any way, so **I'll just say this: Watch it.** Not first, it's just too... Palauish, to avoid spoilers, to be a good introduction to the show. But once you're into the show a bit, watch it. It's definitely, *deffffinitely* a high point of the franchise with some shocking, compelling, emotional storylines and entertaining characters, a very popular/respected winner (whose story is probably enhanced by chronological viewing), probably the best challenges ever in Survivor (I don't give a shit about challenges 9 times out of 10 and I *still* love Palau's), and a brilliant military theme that helps to set it apart from other ones. I think it also benefits even more from a second viewing (and then a third... and then a fourth...) I can understand how some episodes and some of the cast don't land with some viewers, but its many strengths mean it's absolutely worth seeing. And the finale in particular is just otherworldly amazing. If that finale, that Final Immunity Challenge and its buildup, don't blow your *fucking mind* then I don't know what will. (Well, except Pearl Islands, since it blows *everyone's* mind.) 

**My Personal Ranking**: 5/31

**Overall verdict**: I feel like I need to be vague here, so I'll just say that it's one of my absolute favorites, it's a *brilliant* season with a lot of great stuff, and you won't regret watching it. Just have faith on this one even without the explanation: this is a really, *really* freaking good season that you should totally, *totally* check out, and if you aren't watching chronologically, you should check it out very, *very* early (though not immediately.)",3

Love the winner (yeah I know I haven't finished but I know who won). I would say pretty balanced editing for the most part as well. Can't say too much more because I haven't seen post merge yet, but if you want to watch a raw and interesting season, you can't go wrong with this season.",1
10.0,Palau,d3lvjb4,"Palau is an interesting season. Like All-Stars, it is a very dark season, but it is a gripping kind of dark instead of an uncomfortable kind of dark.

The premerge is definitely excited unless you know the outcome. The post merge on the other hand is very exciting. We get to see the inside of everyone as they deal with the emotional trauma playing the game. 

The winner is one of the most badass winners ever, in my opinion. Not only that, but we also got one of the most iconic Survivors ever, this person became the face of Survivor when the season aired. 

Overall, Palau is an excellent season. While the beginning has a very controversial twist, it more than makes up for it by having some really gripping television.

Yeah, some of the themes are a little outdated, and yeah, the editing isn’t the greatest. But I’d say it is an absolute goldmine of fun and entertainment, through and though. It manages to oscillate between fun and lighthearted to cutthroat and emotional within the span of a few minutes. It gives the origin to one of the Internet’s favorite players ever, and tons of other fantastic characters as well. Once you get past the merge, seemingly every player becomes a power-hungry jackass, and everyone starts acting like high school friends one day, turning around and stabbing each other in the back the next day. And this creates a very unique atmosphere that makes it very fun to watch, and the general vibe of the season might be my favorite of any of them. Also my pick for one of the funniest seasons, with countless hilarious scenes sprinkled throughout. While a lot of your opinion will be determined by how you feel about the season’s outcome, keep in mind that the winner did everything they had to do, did just about everything right and just about nothing wrong. Just a great collection of fun moments and characters that makes for some very entertaining television.

6.0,The Amazon,d3j13pc,"It had much better casting than Thailand and was hailed as the best season since Borneo at the time it aired, but it... hasn't held up well, over the years. You'll see what I mean when you watch the early episodes. I think Amazon's reputation has been inflated by the season's initial goodwill when it aired as well as one of its contestants later becoming an extremely influential figure in the Survivor community. 

This was a big season strategy-wise and was probably the most unpredictable season yet. The winner is somewhat controversial in the Survivor community for editing reasons. 

If nothing else, this season is an excellent appetizer for one of the two true gems of the first seven seasons: Pearl Islands. If you watch those two seasons back to back you'll see how the ideas and strategies first put into play here snowballed into one of the greatest seasons ever there.",5

As the first season to have a male/female split, there are definitely some comments that are extremely outdated and unsavory, but overall I think the tribe divisions lend the early parts of the season a light, comedic air that endears you to the cast. 

It also happens to have my all-time favorite Survivor player, Deena Bennett, in it. <3 And for people just getting into the Survivor community, this season introduces us to Rob Cesternino, who now runs arguably the most prominent Survivor podcast out there, Rob Has a Podcast.",2

6.0,The Amazon,d3jakpv,"It's interesting to me that this sub has seemingly soured on Amazon over time. I'm not a fan of it myself, but I think it's something that would appeal to a lot of people here: it is a very groundbreaking season in context and has more visibly ""modern"" strategy than any season before it. And the contestant at the center of that is one of the most popular ones on this subreddit. I feel like the average /r/survivor user would probably love Amazon.

I'm not crazy about it but it is typically a pretty popular one. It's fun, it's exciting, and it's especially unlike the first five seasons and enhanced by them. Definitely worth seeing at some point, probably early on in your viewing as a popular season that's critical to the show's development, even if it is not a personal favorite of mine. But it is certainly not without its flaws.

**My Personal Ranking:** 18/31

**Overall verdict:** Fun, exciting, unpredictable. Just generally agreeable Survivor that's pretty easy to sit down, watch, and really, really enjoy, and certainly a season worth viewing.

It's basically a Seinfeld-esque sitcom, but it's actually Survivor, and some of the all-time funniest characters and moments in my opinion come from this season. I find it hard to believe that half the contestants are actually real people who exist on this Earth. Oh, and one of the contestants who makes it to the endgame is a near-universally adored figure who later returned two more times, and for good reason.

Pretty much all the best, wackiest, most dynamic characters ended up on one tribe by sheer happenstance, which gives us enough hilarity throughout the season to overshadow some of the kind of awkward and unnecessary twists. (With its format and twists, I think Panama *should* have been kinda awful - but it turned out to be too fucking hilarious to be awful.)

If you're more into strategy, Panama provides that as well. It births a contestant who's widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of Survivor - and they also happen to be maybe the most likable character of the season, an absolutely perfect combination. Their journey alone would make the whole season worth watching even if it *weren't* fucking hilarious besides that... so when you add all of that together, you have a season that ranked in my top 10 until very recently, ranks in very many people's, and is generally a super entertaining season. That I think 10 seasons are better just speaks to the overall quality of this franchise. Watch it. You'll smile.

**My Personal Ranking**: 11/31

**Overall verdict**: A simple, fun season that will keep you laughing, that will keep you interested, and that it's really hard to complain about, due to having one of the oddest assortments of characters in Survivor history. It's still kind of hard for me to believe that this season actually happened.",3

1.0,Borneo,d3izolc,"**Obligitory if you can, start from 1 and work your way up comment.**

Not only is Borneo the season that started, well, everything. It's historically important. Survivor had practically no ""gameplay"" in the beginning. It was untested and unmarked territory. The players of this season, along with being hilarious and fabulous, mapped it all out, including everything that would come after. As well as being amazing on it's own, it enhances the watching experience of every season that comes after it by providing information, history and context that you could only learn from watching from 1 up. That's a really neat experience that not a lot of people get to have, so give it a shot!

That said, if you try it, and just can't get through it because of it's age or any other factor, give one of the more modern higher recommended seasons a go, (I'm imagining Tocantins, China, Pearl Islands & Cagayan will be up there - all good seasons to hook someone with) and come back to it later. Maybe even go far back as you can until you find a season that looks interesting to you, and work your way up from there instead.

[-Edit to include a link to Dabu's post because it's Top Tier and down far too low in the comments for my taste.](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/4kzd4g/the_fifth_biannual_rsurvivor_which_seasons_should/d3ja8wn)",28
1.0,Borneo,d3ja8wn,"I super strongly recommend that people start with this season and watch in order (even if not watching *every single* season.)

Honestly, I kinda have a problem with the whole conversation piece of ""I want to watch old seasons - so which ones are the best?"" Not that I blame people for asking it, or for answering it (hell, I'm answering it myself in this thread) - but I just don't agree with the idea of watching based on which ones people say are ""the best."" And here's why:

* **There really is no objective ""the best"":** different people like and dislike different seasons, and **you don't know who you're going to agree with** until you watch them. There are probably some general trends, true, like odds are season twenty-two isn't going to be your favorite, and you're prooobably going to like season four more than season twenty-four. But outside of the super extreme examples of really, really popular and unpopular seasons - as far as the middle, *most seasons,* go - opinions vary wildly (and they even do at the extremes for some people.) So if you say ""Hey, which seasons are the best?"", you're really just asking ""Which seasons happen to be popular among the people in this particular community who decided to look at and contribute to this particular thread?"" - which might not be indicative of what you'll end up agreeing with. (Although this thread's visibility and massive activity could mediate this problem by providing a broad consensus, if you want a consensus.)

* **I think it's kind of a spoiler in itself to say ""Oh this season is great! It's so unpredictable!""** Then you go into that season knowing that the dynamics are probably going to change at some point, that there'll be a major blindside of the person who seems to be in power or whatever. If you go in having no idea what'll happen either way, having no idea what people think and why, then it'll be the ultimate state of unspoiled-ness - you'll be a totally unspoiled blank slate. And then when you end up watching one of the really freaking crazy seasons, you'll be like :OOO because you had no idea that they were going to be an unpredictable one. When you watch a season live as it airs, you have virtually no idea whether it'll be good or bad; watching in an objective chronological order that isn't defined by ""good"" or ""bad"" recreates this aspect of the experience as much as possible.

* Context enhances every single season. Every single season is more powerful, for better or worse, when you can compare it to those that came around and came before it. **This is especially prevalent in the earliest seasons:** watching season 18 before season 17, when new kinds of strategy and dynamics have pretty much been locked down, probably won't matter that much. But watching season 26 before season 2 definitely does; even watching season 4 before 3 does.

* **The early seasons are a really different show than the most recent ones,** and you'll probably **enjoy that show more if you watch it first**... and enjoy the more recent show more if you've seen the previous seasons that laid its foundation. (This isn't to say ""Oh, the show was kind of okay at first but then it got REALLY good! So watch the mediocre early ones before you get spoiled by how great the show eventually is!"" or anything like that; I personally think all the best seasons were the earliest ones. But they're good in a kind of way that's sometimes harder to appreciate when you're only accustomed to later ones.)

If you're *totally* sure that you're not going to watch a bunch of Survivor and you're just into it more casually (which probably isn't the case for many people spending their time looking at a thread on here), and if you're gonna watch a few seasons then check out, then maybe it makes more sense to go with some of the most popular ones (although even then, for my money, 1/3/4 and 7 are the best in the franchise... but, of course, that's just my opinion.) Even then, though, I'd say whichever ones you're going to watch, it probably makes sense to watch them in order.

But **if you have any interest in *really* getting into the franchise,** if you think that there's *any* chance that you might get really into the show and watch most or all of its seasons to date? Then you should definitely, *deffffinitely* go for the full, chronological order that enhances every season, doesn't give you pre-conceived notions, and helps you really understand the development of the franchise.

And **even if you're only gonna watch a few seasons, I can't really think of any reason *not* to try the first one first.** As I'm gonna outline in just a sec, I think it's pretty fucking gr8 even on its own. If you don't enjoy it and you were looking for something more like the recent seasons, well, no loss, you can move on to them - but if you do enjoy it, then you can keep watching the older ones that most people appreciate more when they're watched earliest.

So for sosososo*soooo* many reasons, I think that everyone who thinks there's *any* chance of themselves really getting into the show should watch every season in order - or at least watch in order what they are going to watch. And I think that even people who won't get too into the show should at least start with 1.

* * *

Now, even aside from all of that - moving past the broader thoughts I have on how to watch, and tackling this season specifically:

Even as a standalone viewing experience and leaving aside all the context and stuff, for those who might not watch much of the show? I still think this season is *totally* a **must-watch** one. It isn't just some weird dull historical thing that you should watch for the sake of enjoying later seasons more, at all; it's some fucking fantastic television, and **if I had to pick just one season to show somebody, and they'd never see any other season ever, I would, utterly without question, pick this one.** Its story plays out in a brilliant way that's told beautifully, and along the way you get some of the biggest, best, funnest, most memorable moments and scenes of the franchise to date - culminating in perhaps the single biggest and greatest moment in the entire history of the show.

**The cast is absolutely fantastic, too.** Keep in mind that the show wasn't a show yet; there was no indication of whether it'd be popular at all or, if so, among whom, so they put together a *remarkably* diverse cast here of people from all kinds of backgrounds who are all entertaining and interesting for a number of reasons - and then **they give each one a complete story.** There are none - none! - of the underedited ""purple"" characters you get in some later seasons, and nothing close to them. Every single person is built up, and you'll remember every single one when they go out, and none of them are given one-note ""villain"" edits that make them annoying.

I chose to include the ""Watch every season in order! And if you aren't watching every season, you should still watch in order!"" stuff here because I guess season one is the best place to put it, as opposed to a new top-level comment, and it's something I feel strongly about and wanted to express. But I know that some people still might not be interested in that for whatever reason, and they will want to just go with the ""highlights"" or ""best seasons"", so in my other comments I will explain which ones I think are the biggest ""must-watch"" seasons even if you aren't going to watch all of them and what their strong points are. Well, **the original ""Survivor"" is a *massive* strong point from the very beginning up through the very end, and absolutely the one must-watch to end all must-watches, even if you're not going to watch any other seasons.** There's a reason it managed to score *51.7 million viewers* (!!!) in the span of just a few months. Popularity doesn't always mean good, but in this case, it transfixed people for a reason.

I think anyone who has *any* interest in US pop culture or television should watch this, absolutely without question - or anyone who enjoys watching things, because it's so damn good. So certainly, *certainly* anyone who's interested in the franchise that it eventually launched should absolutely, absolutely watch this brilliant television experience. Seriously, this is just... amazing, the original ""Survivor"" is fucking incredible. **It's so fucking satisfying and fulfilling that I don't even know where to begin; the entire product, start to finish, is utterly phenomenal.** I almost find it hard to wrap my mind around the idea of there being Survivor fans who haven't seen this season. Everyone ever should watch it, *especially* fans of this series.

**My Personal Ranking:** 1/31. As of right now, I have it tied for #1 with Marquesas and Pearl Islands, but after a rewatch of all three, it will almost certainly eclipse them.

**Overall verdict:** If you haven't watched this, you're missing out - not just as a fan of Survivor but as a human being who watches television. Even if you aren't watching every season, or going chronologically for the ones you are watching, still watch this one as soon as you can. Magnificent television.",23
1.0,Borneo,d3izzfd,"Where it all began. If you came to Survivor later on in the series, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this genesis of where everything came from. If you originally started watching the series with this season, going back to it is like a pilgrimage of sorts.

Nothing will ever be able to capture the spirit that Borneo had. Everything was new and these contestants were quite literally drawing the road map for how the game was to be played. Is it the most strategic season? Not even close. There was far more of an emphasis on the survival elements and camp interaction. It was truly sixteen Americans trying to build a life for themselves. Every castaway was nuanced. Sure, there were designated heroes and villains to an extent, but they all had depth. 

Moral dilemmas were explored. Castaways had to prioritize what they truly valued. At the risk of sounding cliched, everything was rawer, more pure, back then. Gameplay elements that are taken for granted now started here. You can see the metagame being established before your very eyes. Some key moments are the first tribal council post-merge (episode 7), the strategies being formed when there were eight people left, and, of course, the most iconic moment in the show's entire history: the Final Tribal Council. It will never, ever be topped for a myriad of reasons. 

Is it the most strategy-heavy of seasons? No, quite the opposite. But here's the thing: If you're on this subreddit, and you're reading this thread, no matter which facet of Survivor you enjoy the most, you owe it to yourself to watch this season. As for me? Like any addictive drug, I keep chasing that first high. That amazing, wonderful feeling I had with Borneo. Some trips are better than others, but the first experience will always stand out. It was, is, and always will be my favorite season.",7
1.0,Borneo,d3j1wue,"Other people will probably cover this better than me, but Borneo is so different and so unique compared to other seasons, it’s like completely different experience. The other seasons were just going through the motions, producing the next installment in a line of successful installments, but this one had to be a lot bigger than that. It set the groundwork and invented the entire concept for the show, which is awesome, but because of that, there is some stuff that feels awkward and boring. Still, as a standalone product, there is so much rawness and realness here, as well as an incredible cast, great editing, and some of the most iconic moments in TV history. **If you want to watch all of the seasons eventually, this is the only real choice to start with,** but even if you don't, it's an absolute must-watch for any true Survivor fan.

For fear of suffering from boredom after returning from a strategy-heavy modern season, *Borneo* should be watched as early as possible to avoid potential disappointments.

One thing to note is that the season focuses heavily on camp life (because the original concept *was* survival), so it's a major plus if you're in for the character development. I feel like the cast is exceptional, and they have largely positive or relateable personalities.

Everything was so new, and pretty much no one knew what Survivor was going to be, and that was why it was such gripping television.  As far as I'm concerned, Borneo is pretty much its own separate entity in the Survivor timeline.  There's S1: Borneo.  Then there's S2-S18.  Then there's S19-current.  It's just totally different from all other Survivor.  (But still great!)",1
1.0,Borneo,d3josq3,"Before there was Survivor, there was Survivor: Borneo. This seminal series of television gave birth to a genre and generated a shockwave of change through the cultural zeitgeist when it premiered in 2000. The season finale drew in a whopping *fifty-two million viewers.* If you weren't watching Survivor at the turn of the millenium, you may as well have been living under a rock. This is a show that changed TV.

I will always recommend to new viewers that you watch Borneo as early as possible, and that at the very least, you watch the first 8 seasons chronologically (as Season 8 is the first All-Stars season, creating a natural cap-off for Survivor's ""original"" era). With absolutely zero precedent to go on, the game *and* production of Borneo are almost so unrecognizable today that some fans almost consider it to be a completely different show. As a viewer since this first season, my own recommendation will always be to go in order. I have simply spoken to too many new fans who came back to past seasons in a jumble who, after the fact, expressed regret that they didn't watch in order.

**Again, just to clarify: My personal recommendation that you watch in order comes from having spoken to many fans who regret that they *didn't* watch in order despite being told to by more seasoned fans! ** If you have come into Survivor recently after having seen a few of the most recent seasons and are looking to start digging into this series and it's massive backlog, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this gem of a cultural icon.

Some people may feel that Borneo has not aged well--an opinion I personally don't share, but I want to be fair to all perspectives here. Again, as the most experimental season by far, it lacks many of the familiar trappings of the modern series, and significantly more focused on survival of the elements and interpersonal relationships as opposed to people actively forming and executing gameplay strategies. While some new viewers have loved it; I've known more than my share of others who found this season boring when compared to the fast-paced show they've become accustomed to. 

Ultimately, there is no way to foresee how you will feel about Survivor's first season unless you go and watch it yourself. Regardless of your ultimate take-away, I think most Survivor fans would agree that you owe it to yourself to watch the season that started it all and watch as Survivor is born.",1

1.0,Borneo,d3mxome,"This is perhaps the most useful post in this thread. Watching every season and forming your own opinion is the best way to enjoy Survivor, I think. It *is* a somewhat daunting task, but I think if you're interested in watching Survivor, you probably marathon a lot of shows already.

Survivor is so rich and rewarding in how it evolves over time, and unless you're watching in order you really miss that. If you're concerned you might not like the show at all, I highly recommend watching at least the first two to four seasons with an open mind. If you're not into the show by then, I don't think you'd be into Survivor at all.

If you like those, well, you're already watching in order anyway and might as well continue. Season 5 (Thailand) gets a lot of hate on the internet, but I personally love it, and I think if you enjoy the first four seasons, there's no reason you wouldn't like it too. Watching in order is so key.

The first five years (ten seasons) of Survivor is one of the best runs in TV history, because the game steadily builds on itself while essentially never dropping in quality. I hope you watch them all. Of course there are many great seasons later, but the first ten are really where the magic is at, and they set the tone for the entire series.",2

Definitely suffers on a rewatch, but I've been able to rewatch it and marvel at how the majority alliance managed to pull of so many ridiculous moves sequentially. I would say no other season a post merge like this one, where literally every episode has something shocking happen. Every tribal after the merge is phenomenal. Final four is really the only straight forward vote of the game. Granted, a last minute twist and one of the worst FTC performances of the show result in the player with the ostensibly worst game of the final three winning, but to me that's like saying Abbey Road is only the third best Beatles album.

Micronesia is probably the point where the show became strategy-first. This could be good or bad depending on your perspective.

A vocal minority dumpster-truck unloads on it, but frankly, just because casuals (and Dalton Ross) love Micronesia does not mean that we should hate it. A lot of detractors often claim that the focus on strategy and the constant blindsides are a bad thing... but guess what? Not everybody watches Survivor for character development, and sometimes, **a good ole' blockbuster that satisfies the lowest common denominator is what hits the mark**. 

The BWB is a dynamic alliance which sells the season as a fun roller-coaster, and I'm perfectly happy with admitting that I'm frequently in the mood for a ""bam-bam"" movie like Spiderman 2 over a ""scholarly"" movie like The English Patient. Because [screw The English Patient: many of us are tired of hiding our ""simple, unrefined"" tastes and will go for the explosive blindsides.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B57bOy2Dzjg)",3

Suffers on a rewatch since a lot of its best moments depend on unpredictability, but still a pretty entertaining season throughout, with some of the funniest moments in the history of the show (one scene in particular really stands out — and if you’ve seen it you know what I’m talking about). One of the most notorious and popular alliances of all time is found here; I’m not a huge fan of it, but lots of people are, and I can definitely see why. It does have a rough boot order, and it’s often described as a pretty “shallow” season; fun to watch on the surface, but not a whole lot going on in terms of in-depth characterization. Overall though, it’s a memorable season with plenty of stuff to enjoy. Just don’t make it your first one.

That said, SJDS is definitely not one to skip.",18
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",d3jnm71,"San Juan del Sur was hated by a large swath of the viewing public when it originally aired but a lot of the fandom quickly came around on this unique, character-driven season. Every person in the cast has some sort of role to play in the story, and seemingly insignificant pieces from early on end up having profound impacts deeper down the road. If you watch Survivor for the narratives, themes and characters, you will probably find a lot to love in this season. 

I would *not* however recommend this season to a first-time viewer. It's core twist is called *Blood vs Water.* The 18 castaways arrive in 9 pairs with pre-existing relationships (either couples; parent/child; or siblings) with the pairs being split down the middle to form two competing tribes. This unusual format is a strong departure from Survivor's usual mold as a game taking place among a group of strangers, which makes it a poor introduction to the series. ",12
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",d3jb4iv,"I really, really, really like SJDS. I think it is one of the most well-rounded seasons. It's a largely character-driven narrative with a very balanced edit, so you're given a reason to care about pretty much everyone in the cast - a cast that's comprised of very likable and entertaining personalities. And these likable, entertaining people also happen to be one of the smartest and most strategically proactive casts we've had in *years* - giving it some majorly shocking strategic moments and twists and impressive moves... made by, and involving, contestants who have been set up as not tepid gamebots but actual people you'll get invested in. So basically, it's entertaining people whose stories are told in a complex and interesting way and who then play impressive and dynamic games... it succeeds on absolutely all fronts. I can't think of anything this season doesn't do right. 

Some people think the pre-merge was slow, but I was more hyped after the premiere than I have been for any season maybe in my entire time watching, and I think that it really never lost steam after that; episode 2 was kinda ehh and had me worried, but it sets up some later events quite nicely and is a better episode in retrospect for moving the season along. Episode 6, too, is a little ehh but also a necessary evil for the boot order. Outside of that, I really, really enjoyed every single week - so when the worst thing I can say about a season is ""There were two episodes that aren't totally exciting on their own but still make the season better, and I actively enjoyed every other week""... fuck, that's probably a good season. 

I don't know, I just don't get why its reception was so lukewarm for some folks. I loved it. Well-rounded season with excellent storytelling and characters - one that set up its story well, making its twists and turns even more fun. Very fun and satisfying pretty much every single week, and definitely worth watching. 

Now, I wouldn't *start* with it, because it comes along so late in the show's run and the BvW twist (which I thought was handled much better here than in S27) makes it different from most other seasons. But it is an excellent season and *would* make for a better introduction than almost anything else post-HvV.

**My Personal Ranking:** 8/31

**Overall verdict:** Excellent characters playing excellent and exciting games make for pretty much the high point of post-HvV Survivor. Don't watch it *first* because BvW makes it really different story-wise from a lot of seasons, but if you haven't seen it (which most people on this sub probably have), you should totally check it out at some point.

It’s is a very good season for character development, as it’s one of the few modern seasons where almost all of the characters feel like they have a role in the story — some are more props in the stories of their loved ones than good characters themselves, but either way you do get to know pretty much all of them. The premerge is average at best (save for one amazing episode), but the postmerge is excellent, with some very well-edited blindsides and funny character moments, and a very satisfying and agreeable winner. My main gripes with the season are the return of a twist that led to waaaaay too many immunity idols ending up the players’ pockets, and the attitudes of the players towards the end do support the notion of “you have to make big moves to win Survivor” which I can’t stand, but neither of those hurt the season that much. I wouldn’t recommend starting with it, just because the BvW twist (everyone in the cast is playing with a loved one) is so complex and gives it a feel that may not be best for a new viewer, but I’d still say it’s a very good season all-around.

I think it's a very, very good season, though, and definitely one that people should check out. It has some really colorful characters, it has some moments that are *super* unpredictable and satisfying, it has some incredibly complex characters. It has great moral struggles, it has great strategy, it has a bitchin' location complete with volcanoes. It has a great and entertaining winner. **It has pretty much everything that you could ever want in a Survivor season.

I don't really have a ton to say on it, particularly without spoiling some of its storylines, except that I think it is quite good at everything, I think it is a very strong addition to Survivor canon, and it is absolutely a season you should watch.

I will also add that Vanuatu is best described as a ""slow burn"", and not just because ""burn"" creates a bit of a pun with all the volcanoes. If you start it and you're a few episodes in, and you're thinking ""This is okay, but.. why do people love it so much?"", don't worry. Most people don't love it for the first few episodes (though I do think the premiere is pretty great.)

Now, after just finishing the season only a few minutes ago, I sit in awe at how raw and impactful this game can get. Granted, some may find the pre-merge rather lackluster, but there are some truly amazing, cutthroat moments that makes people, including the audience, realize for the first time that this is not only a game, but an emotional game.  As the story progresses, the season begins to become not only excellent, but it shows Survivor in its rawest form. Friends are backstabbed, It features the most unlikely alliance, the rise and fall of major characters, and total chaos all the way up to the end.

People describe it as a “trainwreck” season, and while I think that’s better used to describe Nicaragua than Gabon, it still summarizes a lot of the things that go down here. The cast is freaking amazing, and epitomizes the idea of coming from different walks of life better than just about any other one. One particular set of partners contains two people who could not be more different in their everyday lives, but they’re a great team here, and Gabon is full of that kind of stuff. There is a twist midway thorough the season that some people don’t like, the cast is fun but not necessarily “likable”, and if you want a season with excellent strategy, you probably won’t be a fan.

17.0,Gabon,d3jzvnv,"Gabon gets my vote for funniest season ever.  The cast is so insane and all of them bounce off of each other in wild, unpredictable ways.  The strategy in this season isn't great, and one endgame contestant in particular has extremely odd strategy towards the end, but it's extremely entertaining.  Also it has a remarkable location that really benefits from the fact that it's shot in HD (the first season ever of its kind).  It's really fun, and a great starting point, but it's not for everybody.

I rank it 7/32 ",2
17.0,Gabon,d3ka9l2,"The soap opera season of Survivor, as you don't even know what's going on strategy wise, but you're dragged in because of the god damn drama and emotional reactions the castaways have. There are definitely strong strategic players this season however the characters are far more interesting than the strategy narrative (even though I believe this season still could of survived on the strategy alone) ",2
17.0,Gabon,d3jaxu2,"A lot of the comments will call Gabon a ""trainwreck season"" or ""weird"", but I disagree. I think it might be more accurately described as a **cartoon,** full of funny, colorful contestants hurting themselves in silly ways. And furthermore, the season's core narrative and winner are really, *really* satisfying for a first-time viewer. I think part of what makes Gabon great is that it works on two levels: you can pay attention to it deeply with more knowledge of the franchise and see how fucking weird some of its stuff is, or you can just watch it not knowing much about the show, find someone to root for, and be happy with how it ends.

But what really makes Gabon great is that the cast is just fucking **FUN** - and edited well. This cast is actually my third-favorite in Survivor history, after Borneo and Marquesas.. so basically, I think this season is actually totally on par with some of the earliest seasons in terms of how its story is told and how character-driven it is. It has a lot of new-school stuff in terms of twists and strategy discussion, but I think it's at heart kind of an old-school season whose focus is really on the personalities and how they interact. There are SO many little character moments that I end up catching more I'd forgotten about or never noticed every single time I watch it, and I've seen it like 4 or 5 times by now.

In that sense, **I think that this season perfectly blends older and newer Survivor,** and **this** season is **definitely the one that I'd recommend to start with if you don't start with Borneo** (though of course it can't hurt to try Borneo first then move on to this one if you don't like it.) Again, suggesting that someone start out at a point in a show after 16 seasons and nearly a decade of television feels pretty strange... but this season honestly doesn't feel altogether like modern Survivor, and I think it's very much at home within the original 7 - while containing some elements of the newer seasons, making it an excellent gateway. The other gateway season is China, which is a bit more strategic but I think has a significantly weaker (but still strong) cast and, more troublesome, outright spoils one of the greatest moments ever from Pearl Islands. I would also add Kaoh Rong to the trio of gateway seasons, but it spoils the winner of Cagayan - but I don't think that winner is as big a spoiler as what China spoils about PI. Anyways, though, Gabon is definitely one of those gateway seasons while spoiling nothing.


**My Personal Ranking:** 6/31

**Overall verdict:** Probably the most accessible and fun season Survivor has ever had, due to having some more modern elements while also being driven by a diverse collection of utterly brilliant characters. A really, really good starting point if you're not inclined to start at the original as a great mixture of new and old *without* the problem China has, and I would say it's easily the absolute highlight of modern Survivor.",1
17.0,Gabon,d3jheuv,"I would honestly probably not recommend this to a first time viewer, just because it's so different from what 90+% of the rest of the survivor seasons have to offer.

I didn't really notice the 'clusterfuck of drama' mentioned in the previous comments - shame, because I was actually looking for some. Anyways, this is a good one - and I think it might even be a good one to start with.

17.0,Gabon,d3u8wx9,"While this season is absolutely wacky, it is pure gold. The cast is simply AMAZING. Outright, the strategy does not make much sense, but it leads to some very interesting outcomes. 

The plot twists in directions I never would've seen coming. I've been watching every season blind, avoiding this sub like the plague, but this season I did accidently spoil myself on the winner and Final Tribal. That being said, this season was an absolute joy ride even knowing the outcome, because from the starting point it makes absolutely no sense on how it's going to get there, but plays out in such a way that is both a combination of genius and stupidity. 

This season's gameplay is also VERY unique. It's almost as if there's two entirely different games being played in the same season. Some players are simply there for the experience, others are diehards for the million dollars, and others don't really know what they're doing, but every survivor is fantastic in their own journey. It was so weird to see some of the castaways just not care, but it was simply vindicating of their true real life personalities, and made me love this season even more. 

While I can totally understand why some others might not like this season, it really is a top contender for my favorite season so far. Great cast, great location, great gameplay (even if it didn't make any sense), a weirdly perfect boot order, twists that seemed fair, and probably some of my favorite moments I've seen so far in survivor. ",1
17.0,Gabon,d3jz2ac,"Gabon comes as close as possible to being a parody of Survivor. 

One of the most unlikable casts. Throughout the season, I tried in vain to find someone to like, but most of the contestants are vicious, arrogant, annoying or just all-around awful. And any contestants that can't be described as such are edited into oblivion, never to be seen again. 

Very few of the contestants actually get consistent focus and the editing feels very haphazard. Certain people flit in and out of existence only to pop up when needed (and sometimes with vastly different personalities than the last time the edit bothered to show them).

There were definitely some fun moments, but I just did not enjoy the season at all.",1

You already know these people for the most part, now you see how they interact with each other. No one is wildly different than their first season, except for some of the very old-schoolers - who you now get to see ""play the game"", with varying degrees of success. The issue with a strategy-heavy season is that while it is great while it is airing (when you don't know the boot order), it struggles on any kind of rewatch or a first watch knowing the winner. As someone who watched this season live, I give it one thumbs up, but I don't believe it will stand the test of time. As this is the WSSYW thread, I can't give it a strong recommendation if you know the outcome.",18

31.0,Cambodia,d3jcxn9,"Absolutely fantastic season that you should not watch early on. It's an all-star season in a way and you need to see who these people are and where they came from to appreciate it properly.

Its alt title is ""Second Chances"" and almost all the players take that very much to heart.

People will tell you it's not character driven, but once you understand these characters you'll see that it truly is, and all the more compelling for that.",13
31.0,Cambodia,d3j5wtn,"Very crazy season but it is not a good first season to watch. All returnees and they frequently talk about their previous appearance. Not only that but the constant twists could confuse a lot of new viewers. Since the theme focuses on the progress of the game, it will be a good watch after watching like 10 previous seasons.",6
31.0,Cambodia,d3j8ayo,"Definitely not a good season to watch first, because not only does it contain a full cast of returning players who reference their placings in their first seasons often, but there's a lot of talk about the ""evolution"" of the game too. I personally wasn't the hugest fan of this season because there was extremely lopsided, dishonest editing, with fan favorites (voted in by America) being completely ignored until they were forced to be relevant, and one of the major story arcs of the season turning out to be a lie. Also lots of strategy without too many funny comic relief moments or camp life/drama, and I couldn't bring myself to care about the blindsides because I didn't ever care about anyone being blindsided. Probst's ""play the game!"" really started to grate on me thanks to this season. 

So if you're into strategy, this is probably a season you'd enjoy, and it DOES have a good cast (that I just don't think was utilized that well) so it has that going for it. Also the pre-merge, or at least the first four episodes, are pretty decent. But overall just kind of a letdown. ",7

Major letdown for me after all the pre-season hype.

But even aside from all that it's not something you should start with because it's full of returning players with constant, *constant* references to their past games. The entire season is a sequel to a bunch of other seasons. Don't start here.

This season relies on you knowing previous players and their storylines, because you’re not going to learn much about them here. Probably the most strategy-heavy season of all time, with constant talks of evolution of the game and of strategy without us really seeing anything all that new. I compare it to a real-life equivalent of an ORG (online reality game); not much humanizing of the biggest characters (with a couple of exceptions), storylines that pick up and drop off out of nowhere, and players not even seeming to care if their own position is in danger in favor of jerking each other off over each other’s gameplay. People say it’s very unpredictable, but I don’t really agree with that either, especially in regards to the winner. If you’re watching for pure entertainment and don’t care all that much about a flowing story or consistent characters, it’s a decent choice I suppose, but I’m personally not a fan after the first few episodes. Whatever you do, just don’t make it your first season under any circumstances.

31.0,Cambodia,d3jnem3,"Cambodia can best be described as a polarizing season. As you'll read in the other comments left here, some people love it while others were very underwhelmed. A lot of how much you are likely to enjoy Cambodia as a season is dependent on which particular aspects of Survivor appeal to you the most. If your top priority is strategy and gameplay, you'll most likely fall into the camp that loves this season. If your top priority is storyline and character development, you'll probably find this season to be mediocre at best.

Regardless of which camp you fall into, I would *not* recommend Cambodia or any other All-Star seasons to new viewers. I personally feel that All-Star seasons are much more enjoyable when you have met the returning players in their original incarnations. In addition, I have heard many newer Survivor fans express regret in hindsight for not watching chronologically and for jumping into the more ""exciting"" All-Star seasons without watching the history of the players first. If you are only planning to watch casually, this probably won't end up mattering too much. ",2

I don’t think watching the previous seasons is a necessity here like it is with All-Stars or HvV, since the storylines are focused much more on the returnees’ relationships with their loved ones than on their prior appearances, but I’d still recommend watching their previous seasons if you want to get the most of it.

Anyway, BvW is OK. I went into this season with the lowest expectations I’ve ever had for a season and was very pleasantly surprised at the time, but as time has gone on it's clear that it isn’t anything all that spectacular. The premerge is very good, and there are a few outstanding moments later on too, but they’re mostly few and far between. Some of the new players are really great, and it has a pretty popular winner, so I’d definitely recommend watching it at some point, but it’s already become fairly forgotten (it was the last season to get a comment in this thread) — and considering it aired only two years ago, that’s not really a good thing.

11.0,Guatemala,d3jat99,"**RETURNING PLAYER ALERT!!!:** Guatemala contains returning players from season 10. Do *not* watch it until you have seen season 10. (Not sure why you would anyway.)

Guatemala is sort of the forgotten ""black sheep"" of Survivor seasons. It is unique in that, other than very recent seasons, it is the only season in Survivor history to introduce no players who would later return - primarily because production just kind of hated filming it - which of course deters newer fans from going back and checking it out, and it doesn't stand out too strongly in any one particular area, so it just... isn't talked about much. It's mostly just talked about for being the season nobody ever talks about.

This might make you think ""Well, it's probably boring, so I'll skip it!"" - but if you're seriously into the show, you shouldn't. Guatemala has one of the best locations of any Survivor season. One tribe's camp is located in an *actual Mayan ruin!!*, which is just so fucking cool! It has some pretty emotional and evocative moments, it has some contestants who remain popular to this day for being funny or just plain likable, it has a decently crafted long-term storyline, it introduces some twists that would become fixtures of later seasons. Do I think that it's a season I'd instantly recommend to someone? Probably not. But it's a fine season once you reach it in chronological order and not one you should pass over - or, if you're not watching in order, a decent season that's definitely worth checking out at some point. Not one to prioritize like Borneo or Africa or Vanuatu or Palau or Panama or China, but definitely not one to actively put off like Redemption Island or All-Stars. It has some problems (personally, I dislike parts of the boot order and parts of the editing; I think these are most other people's problems as well), but it has a pretty solid cast of characters and a great location that'll leave you feeling like a more complete, entertained Survivor fan for having seen it, even if it won't be in your all-time top 3 or anything.

(And, hell, maybe it will be in your top 3. I know a fucking DIEHARD Guatemala fan who insists that it's the best of the best of the best of the best. She fucking lives, breathes, bleeds, salivates Guatemala. So, again, you really never know until you actually watch the seasons, which is why it may just be best to go in order and see for yourself what ones you like.)

**My Personal Ranking**: 14/31

**Overall verdict**: That this is considered ""decent Survivor"" just speaks to how strong Survivor is as a show, because this is actually some pretty fucking stellar television. It's just that Survivor is often pretty fucking stellar television, often even more than this, so that and the lack of returning players have caused Guatemala to slide through the cracks over the years. But I like it quite a bit, and you're really missing out if you haven't seen some of its characters, so it's definitely worth a viewing even if it's not a zomgstandout. No reason to check it out early, but no reason *not* to other than other seasons being better, and no reason to skip it.",5

Guatemala is probably the only season I would consider a sequel to another season. This season brings back Bobby Jon Drinkard and Stephenie LaGrossa, two very popular players from Palau, the last two survivors of Ulong. 

This season has some of the harshest conditions ever. It was blazing hot, there was no easy way to cool off, and the season even kicked off with an *11* mile hike through the jungle, which is probably the most brutal challenge ever. 

The cast, especially the ones that make the merge, is **EXCELLENT**. There are so many fun personalities to root for and against. Plus we got one of the most underrated winners ever (at least to the general fanbase).

The problem is, most of the fun and drama gets sucked out of it later on (with one exception, when nature hits the contestants in a way like we haven’t seen since), and while I do like pretty much everyone in the endgame as individuals, as a whole they aren’t a very interesting group. Definitely a season you have to watch as one of the most important ones of all time — 45 million people watched the first episode, and it got to lead out the Super Bowl — but I think it’s one of the few seasons that is significantly more interesting early on than later on, and the lack of forward momentum drags it down a lot.

Outback",d3jp7al,"Survivor: AO is unique among Survivor seasons in that is a direct response to Survivor: Borneo. It was not just the season that happened to follow it--at the time, it was the only other season besides the first. This is where you start seeing production iron out some of the strange wrinkles that appear throughout Borneo. Furthermore, the contestants of this season play the game in a way that directly responds to public perceptions of the first season, as AO filmed in a world where Survivor was one of the most important pieces of media in America. 

But beyond just being an answer to the questions posed by Borneo, AO is a strong season on it's own. As a ""classic"" season you'll find that the strategy and game maneuvering take a strong backseat to interpersonal relationships and the survival element of the game (with this season featuring some of the most dire survival situations in 32 seasons!), but the most important aspect of this season is a great collection of castaways--a staggering ***eight*** castaways (literally HALF THE CAST) ultimately return for a second game in future seasons. Come watch Survivor: Australia to meet Reality TV's landmark villain and seminal hero. 

Survivor: Australia is an excellent second entry into the Survivor canon. More than any other season (save for returning player seasons), it is very context-dependent on the season before it.

2.0,"Australian
Outback",d3jafqy,"If you liked [the Caleb and Neal evacuations](/spoiler) in Survivor: Kaoh Rong, this might be the season for you.

The thing about Australia is that this is the most ""old-school"" of all old-school seasons - even more, strange as it might sound, than the first one. So if you are looking for constant blindsides and shifting week-to-week twists, you won't find them here. Now, **that isn't a weakness** - but if you're a viewer who wants to know **""What season is just like Cambodia?"", the answer is pretty much ""Not Australia.""** (Which, again, not a weakness: Even at its worst, I enjoy this season a lot more than most of Cambodia. To me, ""Nothing like Cambodia"" is very high praise.) Additionally, if you have watched mostly recent seasons but want to watch some old-school ones, I don't think I'd recommend this one *first*, despite the large number of eventual returning players, because if it *is* the first/only one you've seen from that era, I think it'll misrepresent the era as ""slower"" than it actually is. No other old-school season is quite like Australia.

But, again, this isn't to say it's boring or bad or anything like that. It isn't at all. Australia is a very great television product - not just borderline required viewing for any serious Survivor fan who is at all interested in the history of the show, but also a strong enough collection of episodes and characters that there is a *reason* it is so important other than arbitrarily being the second one. Survivor 2 had to be really, *really* good television to prove that the original wasn't just a gimmicky fluke, and it definitely lived up to what the franchise needed. Being as old-school as old-school gets isn't in any way a weakness: The **nature and survivalism** are stronger here than pretty much anywhere else, giving us some incredibly dramatic and compelling scenes that really drive home **how much more goes on besides just ""the game.""** This season might not be the most popular among some fans who really love the fast pace of the recent seasons; there's definitely strategy stuff going on, but a lot of it is hidden or more subtle. **It isn't a fast-paced, adrenaline one.. but if you're looking for an emotional, character-driven season or a season with focus on nature, Australia is very hard to beat.** Some people might say that the season gets uninteresting after a certain point in the post-merge, but as The Neck-Man once said in a rare moment of lucidity between the rabid, frothing attacks on innocent Parvati Shallow fans for which he is most infamous: ""The endgame villains are the powers of Nature, Ethics and Fate. The Survivors aren't contending with a villainous player, but they're fighting the wilderness, they're fighting their own ethical dilemmas, and they're fighting the unknown."" (I quote him not because he's some authority on Survivor or whatever but simply because I think that collection of words expresses an important idea better than I could myself.)

It also has a strong enough cast that they *deserve* to be the stuff of legend: The winner is a major, maaaajor favorite of mine whom I'll rant about at length to anyone who will listen and most who won't, and even aside from the winner, the cast is full of some of the best, most complex, most memorable and beloved characters ever. And on top of all of that, this season contains what I think is **hands down, without question, the best episode in the entire history of Survivor;** even if it weren't already great, this whole season would be worth sitting through just for that one alone. 

Very much worth watching. But I will also add that the entire season is absolutely a reaction to Borneo and how Borneo was perceived at the time: chronological context is more important here than any other season, especially non-returning player ones. Additionally, there's a lot of stuff even outside of historical context that isn't in the episodes but is fairly significant to fully appreciating the season. So I feel **Australia is a season that really benefits from external discussion in addition to just viewing**, and you definitely shouldn't watch it before you watch the first season in whose footsteps it was following (or, more accurately, from whose footsteps it was trying to stray.)

**My Personal Ranking:** 9/31

**Overall verdict:** Not something that you should watch if you want anything like newer Survivor, and neither should it be your introduction to old-school Survivor, both because it's *so* ""old-school-ish"" that it kind of misrepresents the era *and* because it relies heavily on context; there are a lot of reasons to watch Borneo before this and very few reasons not to. But if you are interested in something different from Cagayan or Cambodia and have already seen the first season, its follow-up is a damn fine season containing a legendary cast and the single best episode ever, as well as a very interesting season to discuss, so it's definitely something any serious Survivor fan should check out *fairly* early.",4

Beautiful scenery, amazing use of culture, a really fun and dynamic cast, cool challenges and an unprecedented event at the time that has become a staple of the game we know today.

3.0,Africa,d3j1z7w,"The premerge is explosive and fun, with conflict on both tribes, the first really memorable twist, and some cool challenges. Like Australia, it does soon teeter out after that. But still, it doesn’t happen as quickly or as dramatically, and some awesome rewards and a slightly less happy-go-lucky group of endgamers push it bit higher. It’s one of the best casts the show has ever produced, with each and every player getting a story, and while some of them aren’t the most likable, they all make the season better. I don’t think it has anything spectacular, but it does most things well and is a pretty solid season all around.

3.0,Africa,d3k03ec,"Of all the pre-ASS seasons, this one is my favorite.  It's not the most complex in any one area, but it is a complete joy to watch from start to finish.  It has the most unique location ever, a great pair of starting tribes and possibly the best rewards ever (it's between Africa or China for best rewards and no other season comes close).  It you're looking for something you can enjoyable watch for 10 hours and enjoy the ride Africa is your best bet.

I rank it 2/32",3
3.0,Africa,d3jah5c,"It's often said that in the earliest seasons of Survivor, the location itself was the ""17th player"" or ""17th character."" Nowhere is this truer than season three. Kenya is utterly without question my pick for the best location ever. It's so starkly different from anywhere else they've ever gone that every single second of this season feels so different than any other one - and it's a positive difference, because it's so fucking stunning and gorgeous. They're actually out there in the middle of the savanna, and it's astounding. It really drives home with every single shot that these are 16 Americans dropped off into some other pocket of the world they'd probably never, ever see otherwise, and it's fantastic. This comes into play in some of the challenges and rewards in ways that are nothing short of beautiful. **If anything can make you appreciate the environmental, survival side of Survivor (besides Australia's aptly titled ""No Longer Just A Game"" episode), it's the entirety of this season.**

Aside from all of that, you have some **incredible and colorful characters here**; this may be in my top 5 or so favorite Survivor casts. There are a variety of contestants you'll likely love, love to hate, laugh at, and laugh with. Comic relief, heroes, villains - this season's got a very strong range of characters. It has a couple of the most iconic pre-merge boots ever, it has one of the most respected winners ever, and many characters in between are among the most popular, most unique, and most entertaining the show has ever seen.

And, oh yeah, it has one of the most shocking and unprecedented Survivor moments ever a few episodes in (which, of course, does benefit massively from having seen seasons one and two.)

Above all else, it's just **an entertaining viewing experience.** I love this season in a way that's hard for me to really put into words, which isn't really a problem I often have. I think it's simply that I utterly adore the location and generally love the cast - I dunno, I just feel excellent watching it. You've got awesome contestants here saying and doing awesome things in an awesome setting, making for an awesome product that I'm very happy is a part of Survivor canon and highly recommend to any and every Survivor fan.

If you're going to dive into old-school Survivor, I of course recommend Borneo first, but this is a *great* early season. I also think it is a big improvement over Australia, not just because it relies less on context and outside information, but also because it improves upon basically everything about Australia: it has almost as strong of a focus on the wilderness and a personal, emotional development of the contestants, but they also have a bit more color and ""character"" to them with a more dynamic game, more interpersonal drama, and more twists. Australia may be more emotional (and its greatest episode far eclipses any episode from Africa), but this season is still very emotional and is probably more dynamic and more fun.

**My Personal Ranking:** 4/31

**Overall Verdict:** This is a really fun, feel-good collection of episodes that'll leave you really satisfied. I really don't think there's much to complain about here, if anything. It's just good times. If you spend your time watching it, I can't imagine you'll regret it, and you'll almost definitely come out of it with a few new favorite contestants. If you're watching chronologically, or even semi-chronologically looking only at the highlights, this is definitely another great early season worth checking out. Or if you're watching in a sort of haphazard order without caring about chronology, I'd certainly prioritize this one early as a hidden but equally lustrous gem of early Survivor with some fantastic characters.",6

3.0,Africa,d3je03a,"Nothing to really write home about here. Definitely a good season in it's own right, especially with the diverse personalities of all of the cast members.

It's probably my second favorite ever, with a dynamic cast, a fantastic location, and the first ever ""twist"" that completely changed the way the game was played and heavily influenced future seasons. 

As with most ""old-school"" seasons, the strategy takes a backseat to the characters/camp life, especially in the later episodes of the postmerge, but there are some significant strategic innovations that take place here [(one tribe deliberately throws a challenge to get rid of a particular member)](/spoiler). Well worth a watch in my opinion.",2

3.0,Africa,d3jsbmn,"**Grade** **B**

Out of the first 8 seasons, Africa gets lost in the shuffle, partly because it aired a month after 9/11. Africa is not the cultural phenomenon of S1 and S2, not the strategy shift of S4 and S6, not as despised as S5 and S8, and not as revered as S7. But Africa is a solid old-school season that contains great characters, including the most likable winner in show history. While the conditions are brutal, the wildlife and scenery (plus great tribal council set) enhance the theme of Africa. And the reward challenges this season still remain Survivor's best.

As for the cast, there are a lot of great characters. You got your heroes and villains on both sides, and you got the first real ""twist"" in the history of the show which really changes things up. You have one of the most likable winners ever. Plus the rewards are awesome.

The third episode and especially the eighth episode are paradigm shifters that are extremely important in establishing the current metagame. 

As with most of the early seasons, characterization and survival elements are on point. You'll find people to root for and against, and, for possibly the first time in the series, you'll wonder what's going to happen next. Great rewards with one hilarious pairing in particular, and one of the most unique final fives that you're ever going to see.

There are so many different stories all going on at the same time, all coming together in ways that no other season has really quite been able to pull off, and the editing is possibly the best Survivor has ever done. Some all-time great characters, some absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary gameplay, and one of the most intense Survivor moments of all time at the final four. You do really get attached to the characters, among them some comedians, some nice people, some good villains, and some of the most emotional moments of all time.

Rank: #19/32",3
4.0,Marquesas,d3jaje5,"Marquesas is fucking godly.

Marquesas is also *the* biggest argument in favor of chronological viewing; the sort of inter-season story of 1 through 4, with a payoff this season, is enhanced *so* much with the context of the previous seasons. While Every-Single-Season-In-Chronological-Order is the best way to go if you're watching all the seasons, I think seasons 1-4 are where the chronology is most critical (and then 6/7 are a great follow-up to 4, with 5 - though underrated in my opinion - as skippable if you're not going to watch the whole show.) Marquesas is *revolutionary,* it is *the* most important season to the development of the game after Borneo bar none, and it is the season everybody wanted to exist since episode seven of Borneo.

All chronology aside though? Fuck, this is still fantastic television. It is the APEX of post-Borneo Survivor storytelling. I feel, honestly, like it is just about everything that any Survivor season ever could or should hope to be. Its narrative is probably the most complex, complete, and fulfilling of any season's ever, other than maybe the first one. It's so well-told, so rich and deep, and every contestant, by the time they're out, really does have their path explored in a unique, interesting way, and that path ties necessarily into the paths of all the *other* contestants; it's a brilliant network of complex, interweaving narratives. And that isn't to say that every single contestant gets a major or visible edit, but almost all of them do, and even the ones who don't do have storylines of their own.

And those storylines are all pretty fucking excellent, and they culminate in major climaxes - climaxes that are all the more rewarding for how well they were set up. **It doesn't just rely on Big Moments; it sets the stage very well *for* those moments,** it lets you get to know the people involved, their personalities, their positions, their motivations... so the result is that when big things happen, they're really, really big and satisfying.

It's just.. it's amazing: you have so many moments here that are unlike anything that came before, yet are still perfectly set up within *this* narrative to be wonderful television even in a vacuum, and that then set the stage for future seasons. It is a critical turning point due to some amazing climaxes, and the stories that lead to those climaxes are told so well.

It also has what I consider the best and craziest endgame in Survivor history. The last two episodes are just nuuuuuts, they're compelling and exciting and shocking all at once, with what might be my all-time favorite Survivor finale capping it off. So much freaking stuff happens in that endgame and there are so many twists. And with the ultimate outcome being what it is, I think Marq improves even more on a rewatch.

And even aside from all of this big stuff, the cast is pretty freaking entertaining. Even when it isn't being epic and groundbreaking, the season is still fun as hell.

Seriously, Marquesas is just wowzers. It's a hell of a story. Absolutely, definitely, 50000% worth watching.

**My Personal Ranking:** 1/31

**Overall Verdict:** Marquesas is like a too-good-to-be-true fanfiction. If you had, in 2001 after ""Survivor: Africa"", told someone how Marquesas would go - let alone how expertly they'd put together the events into a television story - they'd have said.. what? no, fuck you, that's not possible, stop getting my hopes up. But it happened, and it happened wonderfully. A brilliant and heavily rewarding season even from a modern perspective, and an utterly perfect game-changer after seasons 1-3, Marquesas is right up there near Borneo as one of the absolute freaking MUST-watch seasons.",9

4.0,Marquesas,d3jnstw,"Marquesas is an interesting season for me. On one hand, I really like the strategy in this season, far more than most and I think it is the most pivotal in the shows history other than Borneo. I don't love the characters though, there are a significant amount of boring people in this cast, far more than most early seasons, I'm not that big of a fan on the Marq cast, other than a select few.

In terms of cast, you got some memorable personalities, including one of the biggest names in Survivor history (YMMV on how you really feel about this person). You got some lovable underdogs and smug villains that are fun to root against.

It’s clear that most of the players have no real idea what they are doing, which may turn some people off, but personally I love that about it. It does have some vocal detractors, and its detractors really, really hate it; partly for the reasons I already listed, but also for the seasons’s signature moment in one very unique postmerge episode (an episode that I am a big fan of) and one short-lived twist. As for knocks against it… while I do love the winner, I do think the ending is a little underwhelming because of the circumstance in which it happens, but that’s just a small personal preference. And it does have its fair share of forgettable characters, but that’s to be expected in a 20-person cast. Don’t go into it expecting a strategy-heavy, intelligent cast; go into it appreciating for what it is — a comedy of bizarre Survivor play and funny moments.

Gabon... is also *kind of* a trainwreck, but it's easy to enjoy it aside from that as a simple and satisfying narrative of likable protagonists doing well, and I think it is more cartoonish than trainwrecky. Nicaragua is basically just a trainwreck.

In a fucking excellent way, though. I'm so not on board with this season's negative reputation. I guess if you're looking for great, visible ""strategists"" it might not be the best, though even there I think it's sort of underrated. But regardless of that, this season has an absolutely brilliant cast of lovable, love to hate-able, hilarious, colorful contestants. It's such a fun fucking ride.

Don't watch it first, because it does have some kind of funky stuff going on. But absolutely, absolutely watch it with an open mind, if you are into this fanbase and you haven't, because holy fuck its cast is *so* good.

Also, this season's winner is mentioned by name in Cagayan, which may be an incentive to watch it a little earlier and certainly before Cagayan.

21.0,Nicaragua,d3jpz1y,"Okay, so Nicaragua is one of the most polarizing seasons **ever**. Theres a lot of good in the season, mixed with a lot of bad, and that causes love and hate for Nicaragua across the Survivor fanbase. Ive barely ever seen anyone on Reddit that doesnt either:

1 Absolutely love the
 season.

Or 

2 Despises everything about the season.

Im happy to say I love Nicaragua. It has some of the wackiest, most abnormal characters in Survivor history. But for this post, I want to talk about **one** character, because this one person will almost definently be a huge factor in why you love or hate Nicaragua.

 So the season before Nicaragua, HvV, has what most people (casuals mainly) consider to be the **greatest villain of all time.** I understand why some love this person, but IMO, Nicaraguas main villain destroys HvVs in nearly every regard. This person causes unreasonable drama, makes unexplainable moves, and gets some of the most hilarious, outraged reactions out of who is probably one of the most chill people to ever play this game. I mean, its to the point where this person makes Jeff **speechless.**  Yes, the Jeff Probst, whos been hosting Survivor for 10 years at the time, has absolutely no words for the complete and utter insanity that is this player.

 This player would probably be in the Survivor HOF somewhere if not for one decision they made. This one decision massively altered the game, and probably lost this player a lot of support from fans.

 Now, for those whove seen Nicaragua and know exactly who Im talking about, youre probably either appreciating the fact that this player is getting some love, or youre wondering how in the hell I could say one good thing about this player. Well guess what, its my opinion, and Im holding on to it til the day I die (is this too dramatic? Probably, but who cares.) Im most definently in the minority when I say that I feel this character is amazing, there are a lot of people who consider this player a season ruining asshole that spreaded negativity, and even though I respect their opinions, I think they are 100% wrong /s.

There are some positives to it; one tribe in particular is very fun to watch, and as I said, the cast as a whole is likable enough.

If you want to fully understand Survivor, how it works, and discuss it on the internet, it’s an absolute must-watch at some point. But just make sure that when you’re watching it you keep an open mind about what is actually going on the entire time, remembering that the editors pack hundreds of hours of footage into 14 43-minute episodes. And for the love of god, don’t make it the first, second, or even 5th season you watch.

19.0,Samoa,d3j6yxb,"I'm pretty neutral with *Samoa* to be honest. The strategy aspect does get oversaturated over time, and one tribe's members are so invisible - even through the merge - that there is little reason to support them based on their character. That being said, however, it isn't completely boring. There are enough stirs to shake up the season, and season does get better as it goes despite the lopsided edits.

Don't start with this season. Don't put this season anywhere near your starting point. It's just about the biggest misrepresentation of the franchise that I can possibly imagine. No other season has an edit or narrative like this one, and that is not an endorsement of it.

I think it has a great cast on paper, I think in theory it could have been a top, like, 6 season of all time, buuut none of that matters. What you'll watch here is the edited product, and the edited product is so fucking frustrating, so weird, and SUCH a misrepresentation of everything about Survivor that it should not be anywhere near the first one you watch.

Some people do like it in spite of its edit, so even though it's an easy bottom-tier season for me, maybe it'll end up in *your* top 6 or higher... but regardless, I cannot stress enough how much this season is an anomaly that should not be anywhere close to the first season you watch.

**My Personal Ranking:** 27/31

Cook islands has a great story line, Characters, Villains and Heroes; There are people you root for but there will be people you will dislike too. New strategies are also invented and players strive for power. There are some fantastic storytellers who will carry the amazing narrative.

Pre-Merge has some few amazing moments but i have to agree it can get be dull sometimes. Post-Merge on the other hand is solid in my opinion.

Much of how individual viewers receive this polarizing season depends on how much you end up liking or disliking the focal characters in this season.

- The cast is an awesomely eclectic mix of fun, weird, smart, stealthy, heroic, and villainous. There will be some people you root for and some you can't wait to see voted off. There are people who focus on strategy, people who focus on physical strength, people who focus on social game. You'll be able to see several different types of gameplay in action.

- There are a bunch of players in this season who go on to become returning players in future seasons, so it's a great origin story for them, and a great jumping-off place for future viewing.

- There's a mid-game twist that changes *everything*. It's the kind of season that can be clearly divided into ""before"" and ""after."" The status quo isn't just broken, it's shattered into a million pieces while everyone picks up the jagged remains and stabs each other with them, and it's incredibly exciting to watch.

There’s also so many twists that it’s hard to really classify it as a pure, fair game. It does introduce some players who would go onto be important later on, the location is absolutely stunning, there are some pretty cool challenges and theming (it has my favorite Tribal Council set ever), and as I said it does have quite a bit of fans, so I guess I’d say it’s worth checking out at some point.

13.0,Cook Islands,d3jausx,"Cook Islands is often a kind of polarizing season. Personally, I really, really, *reaaally* dislike it. I think it's incredibly dull, I think its only ostensibly and potentially notable storylines are the direct result of lame twists and have their effects diminished by the minor edits or dull personalities of the contestants they involved, I think it's *easily* the worst cast in Survivor history (maybe bested by S26) despite a few stars.. **When people just say ""CI is boring"", I think that's giving it too much credit,** because it's *also* a convoluted mess of horrible editing, boring contestants, and pointless twists.

But, that said, a lot of people do really enjoy it, so it can't hurt to check it out at some point, because maybe you'll be one of them. Consensus is often that it's good the first time around, then sucks on the rewatch (though I didn't care for it the first time, either, after the first couple episodes.)

However, even outside of my typical ""watch in order!"" recommendation, **I really wouldn't recommend this one as an early season.** Even if you like some of its storylines, its *massive* amount of underedited contestants and bafflingly large array of twists leave this a very ""un-Survivor-y"" season that I don't think accurately represents what's often great about the franchise. And there are other seasons that have a lot of its potential strengths (and more strengths) with few to none of its massive, glaring flaws... Even if you don't end up disliking Cook Islands, there are still a lot of other seasons you're almost sure to get much more out of than this one. I think the only reason to put this one anywhere even remotely early in your Survivor viewing is because a few of its contestants came back later on... but honestly, even then, two of them barely matter in this season and were kind of headscratcher picks that shined more on later seasons, and I think the other two have stories that are pretty much divided by season and don't require Cook Islands to be viewed before the others.

So yeah, there is little to no reason to prioritize this, but maybe you might like it.

**My Personal Ranking:** 28/31

**Overall verdict:** I think it's super dull and much of the time actively awful with its twists and editing. It does have some fans, though, so you might enjoy it - but even though it has some players whom production liked enough to bring back later on, I don't think it should be one of the first few seasons you watch by any means.

2- The gameplay is boring. It's a twist-heavy season, yet the constant 'shaking things up' doesn't seem to do much. The only player that even vaguely strategised was cast out as a rat and villain and basically hated on and slagged the entire time, while the others just sat around vacuously doing very little.

The contestants selected for All-Stars were icons, some of them heroes, and they would all be playing together, against each other. What could possibly go wrong?

As a result, quite a bit. Reddit overuses the Dark Knight quote ""you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain"", but it works well here. Because of this, All-Stars is probably the darkest season. Legitimate, real friendships were broken because of gameplay moves. The jury was out for blood against the final two. And we had one of the most awkward, unpleasant moments in the show's history about a third of the way through during a reward challenge, which has NOT held up well over the years. Some fantastic strategy, as is customary in All Star seasons, and it created some legends, but man, was it really worth it?

8.0,All-Stars,d3jalzu,"Hoooolyyyyy fuck.

So I recently - very recently - rewatched All-Stars for the first time. I didn't remember it in enough detail to have a strong opinion of it (hence the rewatch), but as a big Survivor fan who of course likes to enjoy the show, and as a *particularly* diehard fan of the show's earlier years, I went in with as high of hopes as possible. Now I didn't expect to particularly *like* All-Stars, but I thought I could *maybe* like it, at *least* come out sort of ambivalent or apathetic, and certainly not dislike it as much as most people do. I thought that its balanced edit would at least make it sort of refreshing coming out of Cambodia, a returning player season I didn't enjoy. I thought I'd be able to sort of appreciate this one, albeit mildly.

It exceeded even my wildest expectations.

As much as I hoped to be okay with this season, it was so much fucking worse than I had ever, *ever* imagined it could possibly be.

I know some All-Stars fans like to liken it to some epic, Shakespearean tragedy. I strongly disagree, because Shakespearean tragedies are dynamic and interesting. All-Stars isn't some grand tragedy full of dark but polarizing moments that are epic and sure to bring up strong emotions in you. The problem with All-Stars isn't just that it has dark moments. The problem with All-Stars is that it's *fucking boring.*

The image of All-Stars as some epic tragedy seems to come almost entirely from one episode in the middle of the season. That one story, sure, I can buy that it's what S8's fans claim the whole season is. But this season is dull as shit at least 90% of the time - and one particular pre-merge episode is repulsive and awful and, while technically *memorable*, nothing even approaching strong television... and that horrendous episode exposes almost every single contestant who sticks around as absolutely horrible, which brings the future episodes from boring to... well, still boring, but now involving unlikable pricks. And that one ""epic tragedy"" episode around the middle of the season, its polarizing debate pretty much comes down to ""Which douchebag is douchier than the other douchebag?"" So when **the season only emerges from putting me to sleep when it's time to display how horrendously unlikable its cast is to ensure that I still hate them when they're sitting around doing nothing... This season is less like the Red Wedding and more like a dull headache that won't go away.**

All-Stars isn't *completely* without its strengths: episode three is actually pretty damn great, and *several* other episodes (all in the first half of the season) have *some* fun moments... but when the best defense I can make of this season is ""it isn't pointlessly, irredeemably awful *every* week!"", that isn't a good sign. That isn't a selling point. It's more like, if you've already decided to sit through this one, well, you will get *some* good out of it. If you're specifically planning on watching every single season, then there is some good stuff here, but if you aren't... I literally cannot think of a single reason to watch this before *anything* else.

Of course, this is still just one person's opinion, and maybe you'll like it if you watch it... but this one person's opinion is that he'd have a really, really hard time ever understanding why and cannot think of any reason why he'd ever recommend this to anyone.

As a full returning player season, there's obviously no reason to start here anyway. If you're not a first-time viewer, though - if you're watching a few seasons and wondering whether All-Stars will be interesting as the first returning player show and this alleged spectacle of darkness - my answer is an incredibly solid no.

**My Personal Ranking**: 29/31

**Overall verdict**: Avoid at all costs. Highly toxic. Here be dragons. I am not exaggerating when I say that I would rather watch paint dry for 15 straight hours than sit through this season again, and I cannot think of literally any reason to ever recommend this season to anyone who isn't watching everything chronologically.",19

The first 5 episodes are fun, but it soon spirals into a mess including some of the nastiest and most unpleasant episodes Survivor has ever produced. Some of the darkness of the whole thing appeals to some people, the novelty of seeing all returnees for the first time is pretty cool at the beginning, and the main storyline of the season also has some appeal. But I really can’t stand the overall vibe of the season; the players are always either angry or miserable, nobody is having any fun (with one exception), and after the season reaches its climax (which itself is surrounded by controversy and nastiness), it’s just really, really boring, with many of the biggest and most larger than life personalities the show has seen doing absolutely nothing interesting.

It's not fun to watch your favorite players suffering from emotions and broken friendship.

This is one of my least favorite seasons. A lot of my favorite players were just not entertaining anymore, and we have to deal with one of the biggest assholes in the history of the show shittalking the others.

8.0,All-Stars,d3jm4t8,"Dabu covered all the bases pretty well here, but I think I'd also add that everyone played like total shit in All-Stars.  If you haven't seen it, you might go into it expecting that hey, everyone says it's uncomfortable, but the *original* all stars surely brought their A Game, right?  No, they didn't.  A third of the cast is immediately singled out and eliminated without ever possibly having a chance to change their fates, even when this is to the very obvious detriment of some of the remaining cast members.  Promises are made and broken, ultimately leading to an extremely predictable merge that follows the most basic playbook imaginable.  There's some pretty transparent rigging by production to try to prevent this bland death march from happening *and the players are so blinded by their own hubris that they don't take the hint, fuck it up, and allow the death march to happen anyway*.  It's disgraceful.  Almost everyone that was interesting, enjoyable, good at the game, *whatever* qualities they were best known for on their original season are gone here with little exception.  Terrible characters, terrible gameplay, terrible Survivor.  If you aren't planning to watch every season, skip this one and just watch Heroes v. Villains twice instead.",1

8.0,All-Stars,d3jfaso,"I generally hate playing this card, but I think this is one of the instances where having seen all the seasons live, as they aired, matters. For four years and seven seasons, these were the people you rooted for and against. There had been talks about an all-star season as early as Africa, if I remember correctly. We were Roman patricians, and the contestants were our gladiators, and the show was bringing them all back for another shot in the ring. CBS knew what they had and duly made the premiere the Super Bowl lead-out in 2004. 

I think *this* is where the ""darkness"" that you're not sure exists comes from. It was never supposed to be like this. I'm not entirely certain *what* it was supposed to be (I was 13-14 when it first aired and was still some time away from being fully refined in my fandom), but I knew it wasn't this. Everything mattered more back then and so we ascribed more weight to all the events. /Lanza

Easily my favorite from the “dark ages” of Survivor. There are plenty of legitimate knocks against it; the season mostly revolves around the same four players, all of whom are very polarizing; there is a lot of tediousness and contrived suspense; and lots of characters are essentially ignored. But it also features some of the darkest and most sociologically intriguing stuff the show has ever seen, especially towards the end. It doesn’t hurt that I am an absolutely humungous fan of this season’s winner and literally everything they say and do. Lots of people find the dark stuff more uncomfortable than intriguing, and I can’t say blame them, and while the winner is mostly very popular, most people don’t tend to think they redeem the season quite as much as I do. In any case though, I’d say it’s head and shoulders above the rest of the unholy trinity of 22-24, and you should definitely try to keep an open mind about watching it.

Much of SoPa falls into the latter category.  

Combine that with the presence of Redemption Island, the least well-justified ""one returnee per tribe"" of the four seasons featuring that notion, the horrendously boring post-merge kicked off by one of the worst strategic decisions in Survivor history, the edit focusing in on only a couple people, and the generally poor cast, and it's a *very* tough sell.

That being said it has an incredible final two episodes, my second favorite final two episodes ever.  Everything that is bad about the season just vanishes when these last two episodes hit for some reason, and it leads to some of Survivor's most humanizing moments and an amazing winner's story.

It's also a great season to watch if you're into Survivor for the psychology aspect of the show. There are a lot of cult undertones throughout the season and it's very interesting to watch how things proceed from a psychological standpoint.

It's one of those seasons that focuses a lot on religion, but it's one of the (if not the only) season that highlights the negatives of religion. So, even if you're not a fan of religion, I don't think this would be a horrible season to watch.

Relatively speaking, it's the best season of the 22-24 Dark Age. Strategy is more spread out, there's an iconic moment or two, and most of the casting duds are just boring as opposed to actively repulsive. This is also one of the darker seasons in terms of how one of the main alliances is manipulated, and it could be fascinating to watch from a psychological perspective. It also picks up speed at the end and has a very underrated finale. 

Basically, if I had the full library of seasons to rewatch, South Pacific would be pretty far down on my list. But if I had only Seasons 22, 23, and 24 to choose from, I'd watch South Pacific, every time. Pickings were mighty slim during those years.",2

Thailand has one of my picks for the best pairs of back-to-back episodes *ever* in the history of the franchise; excluding finales, I can really only think of a couple of pairs that top it, and pretty much none outside of Marquesas/Pearl Islands. It has a long-term tribal narrative that I think is very satisfying and set up very well. It has some super bold production decisions and twists that are really unlike anything that came before. Production-wise - the props and sets and whatnot - it has maybe my favorite aesthetics of every season. And a lot of people do have a great fondness for the polarizing winner.

So no, Thailand isn't perfect, and you shouldn't start here. Or, if you're a more recent fan, this should definitely not be your introduction into old-school Survivor. But I feel that it is a lot more fun, daring, and satisfying than it's almost always given credit for being, and if you're a more serious Survivor fan who has already seen most of the seasons, I really don't think this one should be tossed aside entirely. There is some *really* good stuff here that for me outweighs the faults and that is definitely worth seeing, even if the faults mean it isn't worth seeing first. I think it adds more good to Survivor canon than bad, and it's easily worth experiencing the good.

**My Personal Ranking**: 13/31

**Overall verdict**: Do you absolutely, utterly *need* to watch Survivor: Thailand? No, unless you're watching every season in order. I agree with other commenters that it's the season of the first 7 I think is skippable. But it isn't even close to the last season I'd tell someone to watch, and it does have some really colorful characters, great production stuff, and excellent moments that you're totally missing out on if you just write it off. Significantly worse than the first four and not at all a strong representation of old-school Survivor's strengths, but still not bad in my book, and definitely not one of the worst.",4

5.0,Thailand,d3luelb,"Probably the first ""bad"" season of Survivor. The cast isn't really likable, and the winner is considered to be one of the least likable winners of all time. There isn't really anyone to root for in general. 

It's probably the only early season that I would say is worth skipping. It doesn't really have an effect on the metagame, only one person has returned for another season (and that isn't likely to change), and it's very uncomfortable to watch.

5.0,Thailand,d420n05,"One of the show's least successful seasons, and home to the most uncomfortable storyline in the show's history. Someone mentioned a trigger warning upthread when discussing World's Apart; if that season warrants a trigger warning, oh lordy does Thailand deserve one.

Once you make it past the mostly unpleasant pre-merge, there is a brief uptick when the two tribes meets - but it doesn't last long. After an episode or two the whole affair falls into dirge-like death march all the way up to the final two. The winner's game is notable, but his or her confessionals and attitude are controversial; that said, I'd say the best thing about this season is their story.

I just perhaps don't watch for the same reasons as you do, and that's OK. Strategy? Big moves? Gameplay? None of those mean much to me at all in deciding whether a season is good, but I understand that some people are into those things.

I watch Survivor for the story and characters and have been doing so since day 1. That's what the show *is*, to me (I don't consider it a game show), and it's why many of the modern seasons don't really do it for me. It's also why almost all of the early seasons were so good.",3
5.0,Thailand,d68r64x,"It has nothing to do with wanting people to watch it, because that's the same ranking that I post in completely unrelated threads.

I don't know that I'd say Thailand is the 13th-*best* season, but it is my 13th-*favorite,* and I do think it is a better season than it gets credit for, yes.

I'd say it's probably about even with China, with me gravitating less towards China because I think a lot of its endgamers are pretty flat characters. I'd say Philippines has higher highs but fewer of them, with a great opening act and it more or less goes downhill after that, so I'd say Thailand is the more consistent product, and they're probably about even overall on average. Thailand is easily a much worse season than Kaoh Rong before the one awful twist, but the awful twist nukes Kaoh Rong in my rankings. Not sure how I'd rank those two next to each other in terms of good/bad because I don't think any other season is really as, like, lopsided towards one episode in terms of how much it influences my opinions as Kaoh Rong. Probably too soon to judge too really.

I would put Thailand above Amazon: while Thailand has some underedited contestants, it also doesn't really have anyone that jumps around as much as Amazon or have as imbalanced an edit, I don't think it perpetuates the same negative things Amazon does, and I don't think it has as long a ""meh"" patch as maybe the entire pre-merge of Amazon. I also need to rewatch Amazon, though, but yeah, I think Amazon is a very sloppy season that has to have some good moments.

Easily significantly better than Cagayan which I think is pretty much an outright bad season outside of the premerge and merge, yeah, due to its baffling re-introduction of an awful twist, really misleading and imbalanced edit, and abundance of bland episodes.",3

24.0,One World,d3jcwdw,"It is I, /u/Number224! Defender of Survivor: One World! I love One World, for everything it has.

Firstly, there's the ""One World"" twist. Basically 2 tribes, living and interacting in one large camp. Unfortunately, it doesn't last throughout the season, but for how long it does last, it is entertaining. Never has 2 tribes clashed into such an entertaining rivalry as One World's first few episodes. It's also fun to see how Salani and Manono's tribe goals differ from eachother. Not only that, but the One World twist also adds it's own great, unique moments of drama and gameplay that can never be replicated in another season.

Secondly, this is one good cast. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. A mix of good game players, and fun personalities. A certain castaway has the best villain arch I've ever seen. His/her reign of terror and intimidation tactics are something to behold and really make way for his/her later downfall.

This season also had a lot of fun, smaller comedic moments throughout the season.

Lastly, this season has what many consider to be amongst the best winners ever. This castaway dominates the game by merge in an elegant fashion. He/she had an excellent sense of timing and perspective that little winners can compare with.

With that said, this season does have it's flaws. A main flaw would be that it's predictable by merge. Nothing is set in stone however so enjoy the shake-ups within the game. Another flaw is that this would be 4th season that is filmed in Samoa. So the location isn't by any means remarkable. Still, if you haven't watched Samoa, Heroes Vs. Villains or South Pacific, it still has some greatness to behold.

Overall, this season is very high up there for me after a rewatch, for being such a standout season.",7

(Or multiple at once, in some cases!) It's just such a mess narratively - and it also has some really, reaaaally uncomfortable moments that leave it as unpleasant as it is sloppy.

Island",d3jr9nw,"Some seasons of Survivor could be described as having something for everyone (strong gameplay; thoughtful strategies; developed and diverse characters; powerful storylines; etc). Some seasons may be polarizing among the fandom for doing some things really, really well and other things really, really poorly--meaning how much you like said season will depend on how much you personally invest in the things that any given season succeeds at.

Redemption Island, however, is not polarizing. Among the people in the fandom who have seen most/all seasons, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who has it ranked higher than their bottom five. A large swath, perhaps even a majority of fans would rank it as the single worst season of all time. Myself included.

15.0,China,dbjmzy1,"China topped the list for WSSYW 5.0 and will likely rank highly this time around as well as every time in the future. 

Beyond being a great season in it's own right (it's personally my favorite), China is a fantastic season for new viewers looking to get into Survivor. It is consistently described as one of Survivor's best mixes of ""old"" and ""new"" school. 

Perhaps the biggest strength of this season is that all 16 castaways are given distinct characterizations and each have a role to play in the story. This is in comparison to most other seasons, which usually have a few out-of-focus characters who feel either redundant or irrelevant, which China manages to avoid. This makes it great for new viewers, as the distinct personalities and presentations of the cast make them easy to learn and differentiate. This focus on the characters, their interpersonal relationships, and their struggle to survive in the wilderness are all more emblematic of ""old school"" Survivor.

The ""new school"" comes in with the gameplay and strategy. Being the 15th season, the game has obviously come a long way from when China was played, but it's a great season to introduce both the basic and more advanced elements of Survivor strategy. There are a large group of strategic thinkers in this cast who do a great job of articulating their thought processes in a clear and engaging manner. And of course, there are a few blindsides and Tribal Council shockers along the way. 

Lastly, China makes use of it's location fabulously. Challenges and rewards really go above and beyond when it comes to involving and invoking the culture of their host nation, and some of the rewards--particularly a merge reward trip to the Shaolin Temple--are alone almost worth watching the season for. 

China is a great season on it's own and a great season for new viewers. There is really no reason you shouldn't watch this early on. ",70
15.0,China,dbjmdiq,"With its ever-present Chinese theme, _China_ is one of the most thematically beautiful seasons in the series.

15.0,China,dbk2y08,"I think the phrase ‘jack of all trades, master of none’ applies really well to China.  There’s no area where it fails as a Survivor season.  It has a really strong cast, a great location, some really cool challenges, a strong winner, good strategy, amazing drama, a lot of hilarious moments etc.  China has it all.  If Survivor seasons had a report card for their various qualities, China would score a solid 94% in all of them.  On average I’d say this is the best Survivor season, I just happen to like certain qualities of Palau, Africa, Pearl Islands and Nicaragua better than China.

If you’re not looking to start off with season 1, I think China is a really good starting point for the reasons I just mentioned.  In addition, after seeing China you can figure out what you like in a Survivor season and watch other seasons that excel in those areas.  It’s a great starting point for any Survivor fan.

15.0,China,dbjp2hs,"China doesn’t have the most interesting strategy. It doesn’t have the greatest endgame. There aren’t any episodes I look at and would consider among Survivor’s all time best. But it has one thing that’s absolutely perfect, and that is THE CAST. Without a doubt, far and away my favorite cast Survivor has ever produced. Every single one of them fills their role incredibly well, and every single one of them feels like an important part of the season — something practically unheard of from any season after the first 3 or 4. It’s just a collection of interesting people doing interesting things, and interacting in fun ways. The location and integration with the culture is the best Survivor has ever done. One nighttime challenge requires the players to create a Chinese fireworks display, and later some of them go to the Great Wall of China and the Shaolin Temple — I mean, how freaking cool is that?? If you don’t want to start with Borneo, this is definitely the best choice as the perfect blend of old style and new style. It isn’t too complicated strategically (but it isn’t too stagnant, either — there are definitely some shakeups and unpredictable moments), it’s just a brilliant collection of characters with a balanced edit and very satisfying winner. An excellent introduction to the show. Go watch it.

For the reward they go to Chinese landmarks and tourist attractions.

* The episodes are consistently great throughout the season with little to no drop in quality.

15.0,China,dbjzb3l,"*China* is that rare season that does nothing ""wrong"". It doesn't have the *best* cast, but everyone at least contributes to the season, and it doesn't feel like there's the cannon fodder of other seasons. Everyone is well-utilized, and one of the cast members is a delightful, quotable snark machine that elevates everyone around them. It has an excellent location with a well-used theme, and the art direction is on-point. There aren't any A+ episodes that will have you clapping like a seal (except maybe the second post-merge episode), but it doesn't have any bad episodes that you're trying to drudge through.

Basically, while other seasons are excellent in one or two areas, China is good across the board. There's lots of interesting strategy and maneuvering, there are compelling underdogs to root for, and there isn't anything it really whiffs on. Strongly recommended.

As for returnees, *China* has had four returning players, appearing on *Micronesia*, *Heroes vs. Villains*, and *Cambodia*.",2
15.0,China,dbk6h6p,"Do not watch before Pearl Islands. Do not. Do not. It spoils one of the most epic moments in Survivor history.

There's a reason it's widely beloved, which is that it's got something for everyone. ",2

Features one of the best snarkers in Survivor history.",2
15.0,China,dbjqdb1,"While I think this is a great season, there is something that can't go unsaid. There is a twist in China that screws over a few people's gameplay and would've preferred for survivor to do without.",1
15.0,China,dbjra83,Incredible season,1
15.0,China,dbjunyo,"What I think makes China especially valuable is its role as **a blend of older and newer Survivor,** which makes it a pretty strong starting point. I would of course recommend Borneo first, and I'd be more inclined to start with Gabon or Kaoh Rong for a modern season - but as far as China itself goes, it's definitely a strong season with no real holes or weirdness that contains pretty much everything that's good about the show. It has some great cultural stuff and is a fairly character-driven season with balanced editing, like a lot of the earlier ones, but it has the twists and strategic focus of a later season. On top of that, there's really nothing particularly *wrong* with this season that I see turning off a new viewer.

I don't love the season myself, but that's mostly me being weird and being unable to get into the cast. I do, however, think most other seasons have a little bit more to make them stand out from others - but again, there's really nothing *bad* here, either, and there's a well-rounded assortment of good. So it's sort of like **a sample platter of all of what Survivor has to offer: it may not provide the most of any one thing, but it provides some of everything,** and it can let you decide what main course you want next. (And most people rank it much higher than I do or even have it among their all-time favorites. So when I say it doesn't excel at anything, that doesn't mean it doesn't stand out as an overall product.)

...However, one problem with starting here (which isn't a problem for the actual season, so it's often forgotten) is that China explicitly spoils a moment from Pearl Islands that's widely considered one of the greatest and most shocking moments in the entire history of the show, or even the single best. A contestant references it very directly in a confessional. Considering that a significant number of viewers consider this the *best Survivor moment ever*, I think it's worth pointing out. But I still don't think it's the *best* move to start with Pearl Islands (this is where watching out of order can get tricky.)

I already lean towards Gabon as a better starting point, but I especially recommend that when this season directly references an all-time great Survivor moment.

**My Personal Ranking:** 15/32

**Overall verdict:** Well-rounded season that's good at everything and bad at nothing. **If you're going to start with modern Survivor**, then **this or Gabon** is the best place to start. It has no glaring weaknesses and manages to simultaneously feel more old-school than anything since Palau *and* more modern than anything that came before it, so even if it is not absolutely outstanding all the time, it is a great exhibition of what the show has to offer.

15.0,China,dbjvvl3,"If you want to see how Survivor should be using the culture of its locations, watch China. The challenges, rewards, art design, etc all use the Chinese culture fantastically and it really adds to the show. Now, it’s been a while since I watched China, so I’m not as fresh on it. But, I have a fond memory of it. China does have some very memorable characters, including good villains, rootable underdogs, and a very strong final 3. Gameplay wasn’t amazing and the boot order was fairly predicable post-merge, but the culture and the characters make up for it big time. 

Really good ‘middle-school’ era season. Recommended for first-timers and fans who want a fun, enjoyable season to watch.

Honestly the cast is great, and the way these people play the game is fantastic.

And there sits S25 in the middle of all those duds. Honestly, I nearly stopped watching Survivor after One World, but gave the show one more chance. And boy did Philippines deliver.

It’s classic Survivor in modern times. Everything was scaled back to the basics. There are no crazy twists, other than the trio of very-likable returnees, and what was at the time an unusual start with three tribes. The first part bears repeating: there are three returnees, and each improves this season immensely in their own way. The one who gets booted first has one of the all-time great story arcs.

Phillipines has a top-tier pre-merge. It’s a gripping story of trial and failure. And the post-merge is also excellent. This is one of those seasons where the really strong, likable characters make it past the merge. There is no late-game deadweight. Everyone is ballin’, so to speak. A bunch of huge, equally talented characters duke it out for the title, like a good Elite Eight in March Madness. If you don’t know the winner going in, then you’ll think any of number of people could end up sole Survivor.

There are villains, dunces, comeback stories, underdogs, unlikely late-gamers, hilarious moments, sad failures, cutthroat blindsides, a super awkward loved one's visit, and overall a high-level strategic play. There is something for everyone in Philippines. Watch it.

You'll be hooked on Survivor if you start here.

Note that this season does feature three former players who return after being medically evacuated from prior seasons.

Part of it is because the returnees don't have massive fandoms in the first place, part of it is because there are only three of them, part of it is because they're more muted characters and not camera magnets, and part of it is because there isn't a chasm between their strategy and the fans'.

This season aired after three unpopular seasons, so maybe watching in order would make me love it, I don't know. The point is, from a stand alone perspective, I wasn't as high on this one as the majority.

The first four episodes are the peak of the season and they are AMAZING. Nothing can touch them, so the rest of the season ends up feeling underwhelming in comparison. There's a very tragic arc in these episodes that you need to see, and if anything, it's the best arc of the season.

The other arcs of the season aren't as great, with one of them making me hate the entire back half of the season because one character was just insufferable and ended up being the main character of the story. The winner's story is another arc I never found that great, but it's fine for what it is. There is one story in the post-merge that is great though, and you'll know it when you see it.

As far as strategy goes, it has a lot of it and it's nice that it's mixed in with the characters. We know why everyone makes the moves they do as the show takes the time to explain them with care. The editing is pretty good, but there are a few hiccups here and there that leave you wanting more from certain characters and waaaay less from others.

Overall, I'd recommend the season. It has some problems, but it's a decent set of episodes with at least one gripping story you'll get into if not many.

I love Philippines. Features a tragic but fascinating pre-merge storyline (AMAZING television), great characters and narrators, and fun strategy. Compared to the seasons that surround it, Philippines is godly, but even on its own, it holds up really well. Not the best-edited season, though, although this is true among most of the modern Survivor seasons.

The previous storylines don’t tie into their storylines in this season that much, so you can probably get just as much enjoyment out of it without seeing the original seasons of the returnees, but be warned that you will know that the returnees [were evacuated](/spoiler) in their prior seasons within the first 10 minutes of the first episode, so if you want to avoid spoilers, watch those first.

The first few episodes are fucking fantastic, with some of the most raw and emotional moments the show has given us in years, and you really get attached to one group of players in particular. Later on, the season is filled with great heroes, villains, and everything in between. I’m usually not a fan of seasons with 2 or 3 returnees, but this season nailed it down very well; the choices all came in with something to prove and were chosen for the right reasons, and here, they are part of the story, not THE story. Some great tribal councils, unpredictability, and a solid cast, I can’t say anything bad here except the editing becomes slightly lopsided later on (and it’s still a godsend compared to the seasons around it). One of the most universally popular seasons for a reason.

25.0,Philippines,dbk28jm,"After slogging through Redemption Island and especially One World, Philippines was a godsend to watch. It does contain three returning players, so I don't recommend watching it first, but I think the most enjoyment you could get out of Philippines is if you're watching the series in order and you get to this season after sitting through the dark ages (S22-S26). It's the biggest sigh of relief to experience, and for good reason.

The cast is amazing! There's only maybe one or two characters I felt were under-edited, but other than that I love nearly everybody in the cast (disregarding recent events, eghhhh...) and the stories they were able to tell were both compelling and interesting.

Not much else to say about it without spoiling things that happen, so if you don't care that there are returning players, this is a great season to watch to get invested into modern Survivor. However I'd leave this one for later until you, new viewer, fully understand why this season was just so popular at the time, so just watch them in order.",2

The first four episodes have one of the best story arcs of the series, and while a few episodes are weak in the middle, it really kicks into gear at the merge, as nearly everyone left was playing the game actively and not riding coattails. Also, another very satisfying outcome IMO.

Only in episodes 5 & 6 does it start to drag a bit – the rest of the time it moves along at a good pace and presents lots of different compelling storylines. Everything about this season is just really good – good returnees, good newbies, beautiful location, great challenges, good strategy. Solid all-around.

25.0,Philippines,dblmotr,"philippines is a really amazing season and is often considered ""the season that saved survivor"" after its post-Heroes vs. Villains stretch of pretty bad seasons (21-24). with that said, i would not watch philippines first without watching seasons 2, 16, and 19, because there are returning players in philippines who were medevaced in these seasons which would give away some spoilers. but, although you would know three spoilers, they arent major spoilers and you could easily watch seasons 2, 16, and 19 knowing the people who get medevaced in it. Straying away from why you shouldn't watch it first, Philippines is a great season to watch first because it highlights a lot of honest and solid gameplay which isnt always seen in modern survivor, but also there is a lot of weather involvement which adds to how tough this season was. there was some pretty decent strategy but the most important thing in this season was how the contestants played socially, so watching this season first would give you the best understanding of the importance of a great social game in survivor. it is a really great season and a lot of fans will agree that it is in the top half of seasons, but watching it first might give you a lack of strategic understanding ",1

25.0,Philippines,dbngdlf,"**Returning Player Alert**: Contains returnees from Australia (S2), Cook Islands (S13), Micronesia (S16) which itself has returnees, and Samoa (S19).

This season is sandwiched right between the 4 worst seasons of all time and it is FREAKING AWESOME. The Dark Ages were rough on Survivor fans. We had to sit through Redemption Island, South Pacific and One World all in a row, then Caramoan after this one. All of them sucked some major donkey nuts while Philippines was a brief refresher that brought confidence back to the show.

Philippines has one of the best premerge characters and stories of all time. It started out with 3 tribes and 3 returning players, who had all been evacuated before. It hit the ground running and never stopped. The cast is just great and the one-returnee-per-tribe format doesn't detract at all. The postmerge ain't half bad either. The winner is top-tier, and there are no real low points.

Personal Rank: 9/33",1

25.0,Philippines,dbjut1e,"Contains players from seasons 2, 13, 16, and 19, and contains very direct spoilers for some major moments from those seasons. I would *especially* recommend watching **season 2** before this one.

Philippines was SO FUCKING AWESOME to watch live after 22-24. On the rewatch, though, it did go down for me a bit - the first four episodes are so, SO good, but I think it loses a lot of steam after that, and I think the post-merge should have been edited waaaay differently.

In any case, though, don't start with this one, because it has maaajor spoilers for previous seasons, and some of its big stories are more satisfying when you know who those players are. And even without that factor, I think many other seasons manage to do the same things right that this season did while also doing less wrong. It was fantastic live but there's no real reason to start here when other seasons hit its strengths better without any of its flaws and without spoiling past seasons.

**My Personal Ranking:** 16/32

**Overall verdict:** Solid season that's worth watching, but I think it's better right after 22-24. It's pretty good but I don't think it's the standout many people do or see any real reason to jump at this one compared to many other modern seasons - particularly when there are returning players whose previous seasons are spoiled and whose stories this season are more satisfying when you already know who they are.

12.0,Panama,dbjme7w,"Panama is my favourite season and here's why:

* The cast is A+, filled with iconic players. Half of the players who make the merge have returned to play again and the other half each have fanbases begging to see them again. Even the casting duds are hilarious because the show goes out of its way to make you see how generic/bad they are.

* The story grips you from the very eventful first episode and never really lets up. There are underdogs to root for, underdogs to root against, villains who you love to hate, villains who you hate to love and everything in between- but be prepared to scream at the screen quite a bit in each case because it's impossible not to become invested. 

* The locations, sets and rewards are all stunning to look at and even the challenges are a mix of novel ideas and repeats in which even generic parts are filled with memorable character moments.

* The twist of exile island actually impacts each episode and shows you a lot about each of the people forced to deal with it, without altering the course of the game too much. Exile island gets a bad rap on the subreddit because of how repetitive/unnecessary it became in later seasons, but here it is truly a gem.

* This is also the funniest season of the show. Almost every confessional will make you smile and you get to watch the strangest of pairings interact with each other. Literally, the previews for next time on Survivor show character moments more often than game teasers.

* That's not to say, however, that the strategy is dull. The introduction of the immunity idol is fascinating and there are multiple strategic moves and innovations that had never before come up on the show. All of which is all the better because the players involved in them are not just gamebots but three-dimensional characters in their own right even without their strategic excellence.",45
12.0,Panama,dbjo9uw,"Whenever someone makes a topic on this sub asking ""what is your favorite tribe"", a particular tribe from this season is answered so often that in order to have a serious discussion people need to ask ""what is your favorite tribe other than _______"". This tribe is a fantastic collection of clashing personalities that is truly unlike anything we have ever seen. The gameplay is fairly standard, but one particular contestant really comes into their own as one of the greatest strategists of all time with a particularly brilliant move late in the game — and this contestant is amazing in more ways than just gameplay. A really solid cast, strong editing and, above all, funny moments, far outweigh all of the weird twists, and it’s a solid season that just about everyone can sit down and enjoy.

The other tribe is mostly boring, but they're an interesting contrast and ultimately make the season what it ends up being.

12.0,Panama,dbjughn,"Panama is my pick for the all-time funniest Survivor season - though 17 and 21 could give it a run for its money. One of its two tribes (you'll be able to tell which one prettttty quickly) is maybe the single most revered tribe in Survivor fandom, and ""revered"" isn't an exaggeration. Pretty much all the best, wackiest, most dynamic characters ended up on one tribe by sheer happenstance, which gives us enough hilarity throughout the season to overshadow some of the kind of awkward and unnecessary twists. (With its format and twists, I think Panama *should* have been kinda awful - but it turned out to be too fucking hilarious to be awful.)

If you're more into strategy, Panama provides that as well. It births a contestant who's widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of Survivor - and they also happen to be maybe the most likable character of the season, an absolutely perfect combination. Their journey alone would make the whole season worth watching even if it *weren't* fucking hilarious besides that... so when you add all of that together, you have a season that ranked in my top 10 until very recently, ranks in very many people's, and is generally a super entertaining season. That I think 10 seasons are better just speaks to the overall quality of this franchise. Watch it. You'll smile.

There's so much good about this season that I just don't care about it's weak points. It's completely overshadowed because the season plays out very well. I don't care that the winner and F2 are the two worst characters of the F5, because those two would still be funny characters on any other season, and in Panama, they're not even the best ones.

Panama had a new type of idol, hidden in a new way, from the start to the end of the season, with new rules that had not been encountered before and which the players had to learn to deal with on the fly.

18.0,Tocantins,dbjlcpx,"Tocantins is a top-tier slow-burn season. Like Palau, Philippines, or China, it’s driven by a gradually unfolding suspenseful plot, rather than a season that advances chaotically like HvV, Cagayan, or Pearl Islands. And perhaps more so than any other season, Tocantins is defined by its huge, diverse, likable characters. The cast is amazing.

To that end, Tocantins contains one of the show’s all-time quirkiest characters: a bizarre and inimitable nutcase who’s way outside the spectrum of normal contestants. Someone so weird that they’re all over The Funny 115 2.0, and deservedly so. Just sit back and enjoy this person’s eccentricity. Nothing can prepare you. 

The Tocantins pre-merge is a wonderfully cut-throat matchup between two very even tribes. Like any good sports game they go back and forth until one finally runs out of steam at the end. The post-merge is similar to other “slow-burn” seasons wherein a number of highly skilled players duke it out, playing the game impressively and with great respect for one another. Pressure builds and builds until cracks develop and then the plot shifts in unexpected directions.

There are unlikely alliances, huge blindsides, subtle gameplay, great come-from-behind stories, tons of hilarious moments (thanks in large part to that aforementioned eccentric character), and what is without doubt the best trip to Exile Island anyone has ever taken. Tocantins also has hands down the best bromance of any season, and another memorably one to boot. Heck, the refreshing inland setting alone makes this a unique season. And if you like Ponderosa videos, Tocantins’ is heart-warming and hilarious.

This is consistently ranked highly for good reason. Definitely watch it. Frankly, I wish I could go back and watch Tocantins again with fresh eyes, because it’s one of Survivor’s most enjoyable, suspenseful, and rewarding seasons on first watch.

And I think it’s Survivor’s most bingeable rewatch season. The episodes flow into one another so naturally. One of these weeks, kill a couple afternoons and rewatch this season from beginning to end. You’ll be happy you did. Tocantins is eminently enjoyable.",49

Has one absolutely incredible character and some pretty good background ones as well. I’m not a huge fan of the winner and find them to be pretty bland, so maybe that’s part of why I don’t like this season as much as some people, but overall it’s a pretty solid, agreeable all-around season in an absolutely stunning location. Not a bad choice for a starter season, although I think China does it better.

I don’t love this season quite as much as some on here do but I do think it’s very strong and a pretty good starting point for its combination of old-school format/character focus and twists.

18.0,Tocantins,dbjuphl,"Tocantins is an interesting one. In most fan circles I visit, its reception is pretty lukewarm; some people dislike it and find it boring, some quite like it, most think it was just kind of decent. But here, people *freaking love Tocantins.* I don't really know what about it makes it more popular here than elsewhere, or what about /r/survivor makes them like it more.

I think it's a pretty agreeable season, though, with not many underedited contestants, a largely old-school format, a very satisfying boot order and winner/F2, and lots of good characters. I really don't have any distinct complaints about it, but I also think that **almost everything it does right, lots of other seasons do better,** while also doing more strong things of their own. **It isn't bad in any way, but I don't think it's enough of a standout to be worth a *super* early viewing.**

I especially would avoid it *first* because one contestant in particular is... so weird and *so* unlike anyone or anything on most other seasons. I mean, he's fucking awesome. You will know who I'm talking about by the final 8 at the latest. He is an absolute fucking gem of a Survivor character. I adore him. Buuuut, for the purposes of *this* thread? He's also not a great representation of or introduction to the show.

If you're interested in watching more modern ones, Tocantins is maybe a good, like, third or fourth season to check out or something, to get you more into the show before seeing better seasons. But I wouldn't start with it.

**My Personal Ranking:** 20/32, but I can't really remember why I liked it less on my most recent viewing, and I loved it at the time, so I'll probably rewatch it soonish and see whether it should rank higher.

**Overall verdict:** Fun, agreeable season. A little weird in some aspects and too lacking in standout aspects to be the *first* season you watch, but it could be a good early pick if you're starting with modern ones and don't want to just binge all the super great ones right away.

18.0,Tocantins,dbjxfgk,"Tocantins is... interesting? It's a season that didn't really click with me, and that disappointed me because I felt I was just missing something big that would make me fall in love with it. However, as it stands now, I just think Tocantins is okay. It has some great characters, and some fun stories to tell. Should you watch it first? Maybe.

One thing I noticed going through the season was that I didn't feel like things were progressing very much. There could be 11 people left and a few episodes later, I'd still think there's 11 people left. Again, I'm not saying I dislike the season. I think for me, it's fairly middle of the road.

I know I'm in the minority for this, because this sub adores Tocantins, but it really just didn't click with me. I want to really like this season, and maybe on another rewatch sometime in the future, I'll realize what was missing and think it's incredible. Give it a try if you're curious, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",2
18.0,Tocantins,dbk9or5,"Tocantins is one of those seasons that succeeds in every aspect of my criteria for a great season of Survivor.

* Great Characters: Taj, Stephen, JT, Coach and Tyson all provide great story beats for the season. Everyone has satisfying arcs and bring big things to the season. No-one is a one note archetype and everyone not only fills their role but almost all of them subvert their roles.

* Great Gameplay: I can’t go too in depth here because of spoilers but suffice it to say that as with other seasons such as Amazon and Cagayan a big shift in gameplay occurred that shook the game to its core and changed how people thought they could play the game.

* Great Location and Theming: Tocantins is a beautiful countryside with amazing wildlife and stunning visuals. Add onto that with a season that isn’t totally concerned with being edgy or trying to shake things up with a theme and you have old school survivor being played by modern powerhouses. Don’t write it off too much though, it does have some old familiars up its sleeve.

Sure some seasons like Cagayan shake up the gameplay more and Fiji was breathtaking but nothing beats this season for me.

The pre-merge isn’t fantastic and the overall strategy isn’t game changing or anything, but the thing that really makes this season shine is the characters. Everyone who makes the merge brings something to the table. A TON of likable people and in particular, one very polarizing and extremely entertaining person. And, there are plenty of emotional moments that make great TV.  And, having a super awesome winner (not really a spoiler since everyone is super awesome!) doesn’t hurt.

10.0,Palau,dbjmmmk,"Palau is worth your time to watch but **DO NOT WATCH THIS FIRST. THIS IS NOT A BEGINNER'S SEASON.**

The events of Palau cannot be discussed without basically spoiling the entire season, so pardon me for how vague this will be. Palau is an entirely unique Survivor season. It is unlikely there will ever be another season like it (for reasons which will become clear once you've seen it). Because it's such an anomaly, it is not a good season to start off with. It is not representative of the average Survivor season and probably won't help a first-time viewer determine if they'd like to see more of the show.

Beyond the specific plot and game events that make it so unique, this is also a season that has some very dark notes that really explore the moral ambiguity of Survivor, but is important to make the distinction that these are not *low* points. 

Palau is a dark, strange, heavy season. It's not always an easy watch, but it's ultimately an amazing one. This season should be seen by every Survivor fan, but I'd wait until you have a few other seasons under your belt.

This season is **REQUIRED VIEWING** for Survivor 11: Guatemala, as two players from Palau return to compete there. Contestants from this season are also seen in Survivor 20: Heroes vs Villains. ",49
10.0,Palau,dbjp3rd,"Palau really is two seasons — you'll see why — and both are quite good. The pre-merge is entirely unique and leads to one of the oddest mid-season outcomes. The post-merge is an interesting slow-burn of a plot line that includes an all-time bromance, the mental unraveling of an empathetic character due to the strains of playing Survivor with social/strategic balance, and what has to be the best final immunity challenge the show has seen. One character in particular undergoes among the most complete and remarkable character arcs in the show's history. Palau also does a fantastic job of incorporating its setting theme of WWII wreckage. From beginning to end, this is an excellent season, and is in my personal top 5. Watch this one as soon as you have the chance.",22
10.0,Palau,dbjp29h,"Palau has some of the best ""characters"" we've ever seen on survivor. Not the *most* strategic season but it's quite emotional and I think you'll get very attached to the players. It's in my top 3 of seasons 1-14, along with Amazon and PI. ",12
10.0,Palau,dbk32f3,"Palau's an interesting season. It's not a fun season at all; even the humourous characters say their jokes with a bit of an edge. It leads to a very grim but very emotional product. The early season unfolds in a way that some find boring, but others find impossibly compelling. For me, I lean slightly to the former, but not by much. The late season is the real gold here, in particular the finale. Don't watch this if you want Survivor to entertain you. Watch this if you want Survivor to compel you. ",7
10.0,Palau,dbjsw2h,"An absolutely remarkable end to Survivor’s first 10 seasons and my personal favorite season ever.   Palau has a ton of things going for it.

First of all it has a fantastic military theme that is present throughout the season.  Only Pearl Islands and China are comparable in terms of how much they stuck with the theme.  This theme blends into the challenges, which are the strongest in the show’s history.  Many people I’ve talked to who don’t necessarily love challenges love Palau’s challenges.  Every challenge is exciting to watch and you can feel the military vibes emanating throughout the cast while they’re performing in these challenges.  They are brutal, intense and absolutely thrilling to watch.  The theme also extends to the theme song and even the story of the season.

 Second of all it has a really strong cast accentuated by an absolutely fantastic boot order.  Similar to Vanuatu and Borneo, most of the weak members of the cast leave fairly early, leading to an endgame of the strongest, most complex characters.  My personal favorite Survivor is on the cast and at least three others would be contenders for my top 30.  

Third, and most important of all for me, Palau has a great central story that is absolutely breathtaking to watch unfold.  All of its characters fit very nicely into an awesome, very real narrative, culminating in my favorite moment in all of Survivor history.  I’m having a really hard time talking about Palau without spoiling it but its central story is wonderful.

If you’re interested in the strategy side of Survivor I don’t think Palau lacks there either.  As far as I’m concerned, the winner’s winning game is one of the four best ever, and they are very respected among the Survivor fanbase.  Palau is definitely more of a character season but it has some great strategy as well.

There are some understandable gripes people have with this season.  Palau is not a fun season to watch (though I contend it has more fun moments than people give it credit for).  It is brutal and some parts of it are near uncomfortable to watch.  It also has some twists that aren’t fantastic. 
I also wouldn’t recommend watching this first.  There are a lot of things that happen in Palau that need some context to fully appreciate.  I would recommend this season to anybody who appreciates primarily the characters on Survivor, as it is truly top-notch when it comes to portraying its cast as human beings, rather than simply players like many modern seasons.  If you want a season that reminds you that the castaways on Survivor are real human beings, I’d say Palau is your best bet, as there is no cast that is portrayed quite as realistically as Palau’s.

10.0,Palau,dbk810w,"I'd agree, its a very dark and emotional season, that second point is huge at the end. Its a season of two, but both are quite similar, yet different, both ""tragedies"". The beginning is very unique, the end is very emotional. Palau is very intriguing to watch, especially the characters, one of the seasons that comes closest to ""a social experiment"". I wouldn't say this season has the blindside factor a lot of modern seasons have, but there's good strategy discussions. 

**Rank- 3/33**, only drops slightly because the two above it have me loving everything, while Palau has some characters that don't get the airtime, and the opening.

I don't want to risk spoiling anyone in any way, so **I'll just say this: It is a very good season and it is worth watching.** Not *first*, it's just too different to be a good introduction to the show. But at any time after you've seen at least like 2 or 3 other seasons, watch it. It's definitely, *definitely* a high point of the franchise with some shocking, compelling, emotional storylines and entertaining characters, a very popular/respected winner (though their story is probably enhanced by chronological viewing and more unique compared to previous winners than to ones who came afterwards), probably the best challenges ever in Survivor (I don't give a shit about challenges 9 times out of 10 and I *still* love Palau's), and a brilliant military theme that helps to set it apart from other ones. I think it also benefits even more from a second viewing (and then a third... and then a fourth... I could watch this season over and over and still not get sick of it.)

I can understand how some episodes and some of the cast don't land with some viewers, but its many strengths mean it's absolutely worth seeing to form an opinion on. And the finale in particular is just otherworldly amazing. 

**My Personal Ranking**: 5/32

**Overall verdict**: It's hard to comment on this one but definitely one of my absolute favorites, it's a *brilliant* season with a lot of great stuff, and you won't regret watching it.

Possibly the most iconic female hero of all time is in this season, as well as one of the most likable winners, who I’d say is a strong contender for best player ever.

10.0,Palau,dbjpv94,"I wasn't the biggest fan of this season. Going in, it was the most hyped up season I ever watched. Everyone talked it up as legendary with some of the best characters ever... and I really wasn't into it. The entire season is dark, and even though I like dark stuff, it never breaks it up with some lighter moments after the main comic relief goes home. You're stuck with a lot of depressing, unlikable characters and unsatisfying storylines that just make for a really dreary watch. Speaking of stories, there are a lot of them that just seem to pop up out of nowhere or drag on forever without focus, making the pacing of the season really confusing.

On paper, this season should be something I love, but it just lacked something to break up the overwhelming amount of un-fun stuff. It's like someone trying way too hard to be edgy and dark and depressed and forgetting to balance it out. Sorry, Palau fans, but I gotta disagree with this one.

Palau, to me, has really lazy editing. A few castaways are more or less ignored, and/or have their entire storyline within the span of an episode or two rather than their entire time on the island. A particular duo is edited so that one of the two get to speak for *everything* they do together, and the other barely gets any content at all, both on their own and with their main alliance partner. 

The only redeeming factor of Palau for me is the endgame. From the final 6 to the finish, there’s some really compelling stuff.

We have the prototype for hero and villain, one of the Internet’s all-time favorites, and countless strong members of the supporting cast. The story is freaking amazing, and it will leave you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end both before and after the merge — something very few other seasons can attest to. Contains one particular episode that really sends it into the stratosphere — and the best part is, 3 different people can read that last sentence and come to 3 different conclusions on what episode I’m talking about!! The players are playing hard, some are playing well, some aren’t playing so well. But you do really get invested in it. If my life depended on getting someone into Survivor with just one season, this would be my choice, and if you’re unsure if you really want to get into the show and just want to check out a season or two and see if it hooks you, this would absolutely be my pick.

Now the season does have a big twist that some people don't like/consider unfair. Normally, I’d agree with them. But in this specific case, I LOVE the twist. It launches the season from mediocrity to the stratosphere pretty much single-handedly -- but that's because we got very, very lucky with how it turned out. The twist does cause some people to shy away from calling it the best. But still, it's pretty much universally considered the best for a reason. The editing is amazing. The storytelling is amazing.

It’s a pretty solid season to start with because of how strong it is as well as many of its more prominent players being important in returnee seasons.  It’s also a great season to use to introduce someone to the show because it’s just that good.  
One more thing to note about PI: even new-school fans agree on its quality.  If your first season was MvGX or Kaoh Rong and you’re worried that you won’t like older seasons because they are too slow-paced or different, you shouldn’t worry with regards to PI.

Sometimes, absolutely nothing that I or anyone else could ever say could possibly compare to the thing itself. Pearl Islands, often hailed as the pinnacle of Survivor, is one such time. You could probably not write a better Survivor season than Pearl Islands. You could not even write Pearl Islands, or people would tell you to fuck off with something that unrealistic.

So I'm not even going to elaborate, I'm not going to say one word about what makes Pearl Islands so great. Just watch it. I would say don't watch it *first*: no matter what order you're watching in, some of S7's best moments pack a much harder punch if you realize just how unorthodox they are. So in spite of the massive hype, I wouldn't watch this one til you've got a couple seasons under your belt - but once you do, if you still haven't seen it? Definitely, definitely watch it. Go into it knowing as little as you can, and bask in the overwhelming wonder and beauty and perfection of this glorious fanfiction.

**My Personal Ranking**: 2/32 but this one vs. Borneo is like the definition of a toss-up

If I had to say one thing I maaaaybe didn't love, it would be the twist in the middle of the season. It was used to bring out the pirate theme, but it's still a very controversial twist to this day.

Speaking of which, the pirate theme is amazing! Pearl Islands is one of only three seasons which actually utilizes the lore of the location to it's fullest extent (along with Palau and China). The pirate theme really helps you to get to know the location, and you actually might learn something about the islands, which is great for world building.

This is a truly great season, and shows you everything that Survivor is about. Though, most everyone could tell you that.",2

Pearl Islands has the single biggest character in Survivor history. It has the best theme and execution of the theme. It has the best villain ever. It has the best casting job ever, where almost every character has a fleshed out personality and story. It has the best premiere episode ever. 

I often compare this season to my favorite album, Born to Run. It's a season where the highs are easily identifiable, but it has few lows, and its lows are not that bad in context, and are far, far better than 90% of Survivor history. 

Pearl Islands is peak Survivor. ",2

The theme (PIRATES) is incorporated so well into this season that I'd call this the season which best incorporated it's theme except for China.

The cast has at least 3 of the best characters of all time (including the aforementioned villain). They are all great additions to Survivor lore.

If you think the strategy will be boring just because it's an early season, think again. There are multiple blindsides, twists, turns and strategic gaffes to be had.

Pearl Islands is absolutely outstanding and is dragged down only by a bullshit twist in the game. The twist *does* cause the season to have an amazing postmerge rather than a boring one, but the twist *was* bullshit. I just like 3 seasons more, that's all.

P.S. Do not. I repeat. DO NOT WATCH HEROES VS. VILLAINS BEFORE THIS SEASON. You will rob yourself of an incredible experience based on one single confessional.

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbjl77i,"Kaoh Rong, S32, was filmed before Cambodia, S31. It is this to which I attribute the different nature it seems to have compared to Cambodia and Millennials vs Gen X. Kaoh Rong has a heavy focus on the characters. Each and every cast member, all eighteen, are given a decent amount of airtime and a cohesive story, and a lot of those are explored with so much depth compared to a lot of other recent seasons. Each episode has events that are so emotionally charged because you actually grow to care a lot about everyone. There are distinct heroes and villains but yet none of them are so shoehorned into that role that they seem fake - a lot of them are extremely dynamic and developed characters with multiple sides. A lot of the storylines are set up over the course of several episodes and make a lot of sense and are very cohesive, which is more than I can say about some other recent seasons. It is these things that I enjoy the most in a season and they’re stellar here. 

That’s not to say that there’s zero strategy though, because there’s a healthy amount. A twist that probably shouldn’t have worked at all ends up being the focal point of a few episodes and its loom over the game works very well. I’d imagine that without the exploration into the characters, however, it would be very blah, but because of all the emotion felt by both the players and the viewers, the gameplay is very exciting and produced some of top moments of the past couple years imo. 

One more thing - the winner. People will go on and on about how their win soiled the season and left a bad taste in their mouth. They will say that their story and how they won is told terribly. Please form your own opinion on this, because I absolutely ADORE the winner and I think that the story of their win is told in a great way and acts as a reminder on the baseline of the game, and goes against the trash that Cambodia and MvGX propagate so often. 

If someone new to the show was to pick a more modern season to watch for the first time, I would throw out Kaoh Rong’s name in a heartbeat. The balance of character and strategy, the fact that everyone has some sort of role and story, and the overall emotion felt by everyone involved is what makes it great, whether you’re a Survivor newbie or veteran. ",50
32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbk7kav,"LOVE. What gets me about Kaoh Rong is that the strategy is rendered emotionally; people don't just make moves, they feel moves, making for a hyper compelling product. It's a very balanced season, with everyone making at least some sort of impact, no matter how small. The villains in this season are some of my favourite villains in Survivor history because their humanity is always shown in addition to their villainy. It's a new school season with an old school sheen. Oh so worth it.",32
32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbjp4r0,"I really, really loved this season and it’s easily my favorite of the past 7 years. This is primarily due to its incredibly strong cast, with absolutely nobody feeling neglected or pointless and everyone feeling like they are part of the story in a way no season in the past ~5 years has been able to do. The characters are very humanized; some deal with moral conflicts, others with insecurities, others with pure arrogance. Has some great heroes, great villains, and everything in between. It’s also a pretty funny season, thanks to the cast’s wide selection of good narrators, and the difficulty of the elements provide for some of the most memorable sendoffs the show has seen in years. Some people aren’t a fan of the season’s winner, but I would definitely recommend this season to a new viewer in part BECAUSE of the winner, since they provide a pretty accurate representation of the  skills required to do well in the game. There really aren’t many major flaws I can think of outside of one stupid late-game twist, and it has something that just about any fan of the show can enjoy. If you insist on starting with a modern season, this is absolutely my pick.

Rank: #6/33",28
32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbjto2v,"Here's one thing that Kaoh Rong had that most of the seasons don't: fluid, consistent narrative. This season has well-developed stories, each characters with their own motivations that are challenged, fleshed out and beautiful unraveled in every passing episode.   
While some seasons give you flashy, memorable moments, and call it a day, Kaoh Rong gives more than that. You'd fully understand the motivations of the castaways doing those moves. It plants the build up early, making you so invested when it does finally pay off.    
If I somehow imagine this season NOT being a Survivor season, it'd be like an excellent well-written, character-driven, narrative TV series, something HBO or Netflix would produce. It's just that amazing. There are your likable heroes, who face insecurities, doubts and moral dilemmas, and there are three-dimensional villains, who also had their own journeys. 
Easily, the best of the post-HvV seasons.",22

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbjn7ok,"This is the most balanced new school season and the only new school season to break my top three. It's just shy of Survivor perfection and I would highly recommend watching (but not first) in your Survivor career.

Every character matters in the story at some point. No one is fully neglected or left on the sidelines and no one just shows up at the last minute so they can go home on time. Everything is balanced between the characters, the strategy, and the story and it blends perfectly to create the most coherent, fluid season in years.

It brings deep emotions, huge moments of joy, great comedy, and a mix of playstyles to the table. The villains (if you can even call them that) are great, the heroes (if you can even call them that) are great, the season is GREAT. Truly a masterpiece with a small flaw or two of course, but nothing derails it from being one of the best seasons of all time.

Lots of really good moments, characters, and I really do like the winner, and if I had to choose any post HvV season for a new person to watch first, this would be it, it doesn't give them the wrong idea, the big moves mentality, and has a more middle Survivor feel.

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbjlqim,"Ten seasons from now, we’ll look back at Kaôh Rōng the way we do Nicaragua, Exile Island, Palau, or Vanuatu. It’s not the best season from its era, but it’s pretty damn close.

What do you like about Survivor? Kaôh Rōng has it. Memorable blindsides occur from the early episodes through to the end. There are huge characters. Innovative gameplay twists. Cool new advantages. Memorable, unique tribals. A diverse, talented, capable cast. Funny people. Gorgeous people. Unlikely, shifting alliances. An immensely likable F3. An unpredictable ending. Big villains who are capable of creating chaos but then ultimately get what’s coming to them. Heroes you can relate to and route for through the finale. And easily the best pet the show has ever seen.

I’d give Kaôh Rōng a 91/100 at least, ranking it barely behind Cagayan (98/100) and Philippines (95/100) in the post HvV-era. What keeps Kaôh Rōng from equaling those superior seasons is the ending.

I’m not one of those people who was up in arms after the finale. Quite the opposite: I’m perfectly fine with who won. I like when we get different types of winners. Still, I needed a bit more from them. That’s all. Something else to make their narrative arc more complete.

It’s nitpicking, really. Kaôh Rōng is a superb season, an excellent example of what makes modern Survivor so good. You should absolutely watch this season, sooner than later.",24
32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbjmtl1,"_Kaôh Rōng_ features just the right mix of character development and strategy. Once you finish the season, you get to know pretty much every one of the castaways. If you prefer to see strategy over characters, _Kaôh Rōng_ also has enough strategy to keep you entertained. Even though its later episodes do feel a bit lacking, the season as a whole is really great.

There are rootable heroes, villains (that, with the edit, seem closer to anti-heroes in retrospect) that you can sympathize with, and humor. 

The only downside I would say would be the winner, but then again, the only reason I'd list that as a downside is because I wasn't rooting for him/her and that the win didn't make immediate sense to me - the win in retrospect makes a whole lot more sense than I thought. ",15

However, there are some twists that bring the season down, especially one at the end of the season which is in contention for the worst Survivor twist of all time.  The ending is also a bit of a let-down (even if I don't mind the winner).

All of the castaways fill roles in this complex story but none seem to be caricatures. Two are among r/survivor's top 25 favorites of all time, in fact. Many game-changing moves and decisions this season were not only strategic, but emotional as well. Emotion seemed to be a major theme here, and that seems to be lacking in many recent seasons. Each episode was at least an 8/10 to me. The only thing keeping it from being a little higher is there being a bit of a bullshit ending twist.

Good focus to all tribes and pretty good editing, with a few exceptions. Post merge started out awesome with some epic tribals. Good villains.

However, the season got really predictable toward the end and lost some of its charm. The finale was just okay with a pretty BS twist and a mediocre (but deserving) winner. And, I was not a fan of the extremely harsh conditions of Cambodia.

It's doesn't give you any reason to care about the person who just eliminated. It also has maybe one of my least favorite castaways ever, not because they're a horrible person, but they're just **SO BORING** to watch and everytime someone starts to do something even remotely interesting this castaway just says in the most boring way possible: ""well this person is a threat to my game so I can't trust them so I'm going to vote for them at Tribal Council because when you're on the Oregon Trail some people die and stuff"" AND EVEN WHEN THEY SAY INTERESTING STUFF THE DELIVERY IS JUST SO PLAIN AND IT'S FRUSTRATES ME TO END AND GAH. The challenges are okay I guess, the conditions were harsh so I understand why they stopped doing some of the more difficult ones, but it just makes them a bore to sit through.

KR is a strange one to analyse because much of your enjoyment will hinge upon your ability to read the edit. The dichotomy between the overall winner having an obvious edit around episode 4 and fans feeling as though the winner hadn't done much will either please you or alienate you. I know a lot of people who felt unsatisifed with the ending of the season.

There is a twist in the Finale which is bullshit. There are a few male villains whose sexism and bullying will drive you nuts. And the postmerge has a few purple characters who don't really get to shine until their boots, thereby making the aforementioned winner's edit even more obvious than before.

KR certainly isn't terrible, but I genuinely feel that it's overrated. The premerge is good, but the ending and fan reaction to that ending (from both sides of the aisle) left a sour taste in my mouth.

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbo4gfl,"WARNING: HEAVY SPOILERS FOR S27-S32 BELOW

[I feel like we've had this discussion before but yeah I really disagree with most of this. Like I said when I cut Michele in SR3 pretty much all of the drama came from the inevitability of a subtle, social, non-hyper strategic winner (because this is Survivor and that's how the game works) after Probst and production's attempts to brainwash people into believing certain things about the game. The string of Tyson/Tony/Natalie/Mike/Jeremy was about the worst thing that could happen to make a Michele win satisfy the viewers -- but this is not the fault of Michele, the editors of Kaoh Rong, or the season itself. In fact, a first time viewer who has not seen those seasons -- which this thread is designed for -- would get a better idea of the typical skills that tend to be rewarded by watching Kaoh Rong as opposed to most other seasons, including Cagayan. Such a viewer who doesn't ""know any better"" (for lack of a better term) doesn't know to read the edit and won't see Michele's lack of ""big moves"" as a reason she was undeserving, because they haven't been desensitized to feel that way. You make the comparison to Cagayan, but I and many other people left Cagayan feeling unsatisfied by the ending despite enjoying most of the rest of it, and you don't know if a new viewer will feel the same way.](/spoiler)

[The rest of the stuff here is fair enough, although I do think the male villains have a very satisfying downfall while also being fleshed out and humanized and add a lot to the season; and the purple characters is a problem in literally every post HvV season, and I think it's less problematic here than any of the others.](/spoiler)

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dbzl3hm,"My personal recommendation would be as many of these seasons as possible, in this order: 32, 16, 20, 27, 26, 30, 31, 24. (It would be better to watch 24 before 27, except that 24 (1) is terrible and (2) has only one rep on season 34, so I think it's a lower priority. But if you find yourself really flying through them, and you think you'll make it through all of them, you could bump 24 up before 27.). If you manage to watch all of those, I think you will have seen each season 34 contestant in at least one season.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/5ludyw/a_minimal_spoiler_guide_to_watching_heroes_vs/) before you watch season 20. Alternatively, if you know you'll have time to watch all of the above seasons and more, try to watch seasons 7/8/18/19 before season 20 as well (7 and 18 have the added benefits of being the first appearances of a couple of season 34ers who also appeared in S20).

A lot of Survivors ""bloom,"" by which I mean they grow a ton as a person. This makes the post-merge as much about the change and growth of characters as it is about actual Survivor gameplay.

* The people that controlled the game and took up airtime were interesting, likable and unique.

* Lots of really good growth stories.

* Despite ""BIG MOVES!!"" and ""EVOLUTION OF THE GAME!!"" being pushed throughout most of the postmerge, the season has a big heart and is very emotional.

* Despite being a pretty light season in tone, its biggest moments are completely shocking and epic.

* The postmerge cast is really strong with the exception of like, one or two duds.

* The finale is amazing 

* The season is fucking amazing aesthetically. The set designs and the music in particular are outstanding.

**Negatives**

* The pre-swap is bad. Editing is a complete mess, all of the boots are either boring or annoying and the theme is cringely forced down our throats.

* Lacked real stakes until about episode 10 or so.

* ""BIG MOVES"" and ""EVOLUTION OF THE GAME"" were pushed way too hard yet again

Lots of boring personalities made far, some are very gamebotty that it ruined any possibilities of having a balance of characters and personality. Some are shoved down our throats.The grown up arcs were too contrived. The strategy is good but it's like milking the ""BIG MOVEZZ!!!!"" mentality that this sub likes.

The characters are just a bunch of flat cardboard cutouts for the most part with a couple exceptions, so if you don't like their one trait each, you're out of luck and probably won't care when anyone goes home.

This season is really meta too. It constantly shoves ""big moves"" and ""resumes"" down your throat and well as the worst theme in Survivor history, and it never feels ashamed for doing it. It never gives you time to breathe and it comes off as really forced and cringey more often than not.

Overall, it's not a bad season, but it's not really great either. It has some great game moments and some standout characters/emotional moments, but they stick out like giant, pulsing sore thumbs and the rest of the season is just kind of there in the meantime.

33.0,MvGX,dbjpk6t,"Just finished up a few days ago so it’s hard to say how much of its placement is due to recency bias. Personally, I wasn’t a big fan of it. I don’t think it was necessarily *bad*, but just the definition of mediocrity. I had a hard time getting invested in most of the characters thanks to a lot of them either not getting much airtime or being forgettable in the airtime they did get. Thankfully there are 3 or 4 fantastic characters that do make up for a lot, but they don’t make up for everything. The forced theme is ridiculously obnoxious, and even once it’s over, the new themes about “resume building” are not much better. Jeff Probst is really, really annoying here too. There isn’t really much external conflict once you reach a certain point, and the players all get along really well — which to me is not a good thing. It’s worth checking out at some point thanks to a couple of great characters and moments, but I really don’t get the hype around it.

Rank: #24/33",20
33.0,MvGX,dbjvsao,"I can’t decide whether I like MvGX or Kaoh Rong more. They are both great, in different ways though. The pre-merge gets a bad rap but I don’t think it’s awful. It really heats up a few episodes in with some crazy tribals and super-memorable moments. One of the best post-merges ever (I really don’t think this is recency bias). Complex characters, big moves, and awesome storylines. VERY enjoyable season.

The editing is not amazing, though, and some characters really get the edit shaft. And, if you’re into the camp life and survival elements of the show, this probably isn’t the season for you. Oh, and the theme and how Jeff pushes it is super cringy, although the theme talk dies down at the merge.

Overall, a really great season. Shows that Survivor still has it 34 seasons in.
",7
33.0,MvGX,dbjz0ia,"I will go ahead and say this could be a really great first season for a new viewer. Here is why:

* No returning players. All newbies.

* The classic 2 tribe format.

* Normal Idols. No ""Super Idols"" or ""Tyler Perry Idols"".

* Incredible cast with a ton of likable people to root for all the way through the end.

* Lots of great strategy and shocking episodes! It won't bore a new viewer or turn them off of Survivor.


This is one of my favorite seasons for many reasons. Yeah the theme is cringey and Probst loves to shill it,  but once you overlook that it's a near perfect season. All the lame players go out early making the merge full of the real players/characters. I was never bored during this season. ",6
33.0,MvGX,dbkprn6,"DO NOT WATCH THIS SEASON FIRST 

I love this season.  As everyone has said, this season has a pretty weak start and takes a little while to pick up.  However, a lot of things that happen in the premerge set up more storylines that develop in the postmerge and make the season really thrilling.  The season really picks up right before the merge hits and it really doesn't stop.  Some fun characters premerge, but also a lot of duds go out premerge leaving the cream of the crop to duke it out at the end.  Editing gets much stronger at the merge as well.  Some incredibly likable characters, fun moments, wild tribal councils, and truly humanizing moments as well.  I would say that one episode soon after the merge is one of the better episodes in recent memory.  That episode feels like a human chess match and still manages to mix in some great character moments, one in particular that makes the cringe-inducing theme worth it for at least one moment.  Many characters have great story arcs and there are great character relationships as well.  Add to that some great strategic gameplay (too meta at times) and a thrilling finale with a great winner story and this season ranks very highly for me.  Many of these characters will likely be returning players at some point.  A fascinating story from start to finish.

33.0,MvGX,dbk5172,"I really dug this season. It's unique because almost every single person there is, in some way or another, likeable...there are no clean heroes and no clean villains as a result, which means there's more focus on personalities and strategies than storylines specifically. It's definitely the herald of the postmodern age of Survivor, where the stakes are publicly known, and the players fully recognize that they're having an experience.

The ending is actually quite great, and the twists are good and don't change the season for the worse.

However, the theme is forced as hell, following a trend in recent seasons.  If the Collars theme turned you off of season 30, you ain't seen nothing yet.

33.0,MvGX,dbjnz0f,"There are some reasons that the absurdly named Millennials vs Gen X is very much worth watching. In a 20 person cast, there are some people who do get sidelined, but there are some really strong stories and characters who do end up getting focus, along with a lot of big and exciting votes. 

That being said, MvX is a decidedly new school season. It is Survivor's most meta season so far, with many huge fans in the cast, and a lot of the gameplay expands upon the forward movement made in the game during prior seasons. 

This is the most recent season as of this thread, so keep in mind that it's fresh on a lot of fans minds and that is going to impact how it is reviewed.

33.0,MvGX,dez384b,"This season is tied as my favorite with Cagayan. I do acknowledge that I possess a recency bias, however. I wouldn't recommend this season to a newbie, as the gameplay in this season is largely built upon the more recent evolution of the game in seasons 31-33. I also think that the meta aspect of this season is fascinating. I know some others who have commented see this as a negative, but personally I think it's a positive if you do happen to be a superfan or have seen a range of seasons, especially if you are interested in strategic play. Another reason I love this season so much is that I can relate to the millennials very closely and the dynamics that occurred within that tribe/beyond were so, so familiar to me. I'm a millennial, and watching without giving any spoilers, I can only say that the social dynamics hit close to home. I also think that this season has so many really, really powerful transformations and story arcs that it would be hard to go wrong-- no matter who you are. I rooted for the winner from the very first episode, so the fact that my number one made it also adds to my love of this season. 

Tl;dr: This is an amazing season to watch if you have seen seasons 31-33 + some older seasons, and can understand the references to the gameplay of previous seasons. Very meta, great example of Survivor's evolution of gameplay. Great for superfans. Don't start here though! ",1
33.0,MvGX,dgywc4b,"Consistently entertaining season with plenty of rootable underdogs and people who genuinely grew as individuals while out on the island. Millennials vs. Gen X sounds like a very oddball concept, but it's so much greater than the sum of its parts.",1
33.0,MvGX,dboqqfg,"MvGX has all the makings of a bad season, yet somehow turns everything out into a great season. Holistically half of the cast are either duds or inoffensive. Probst pushes the idiotic theme far too long, and the pre-swap episodes are a pain to sit through. After the swap, everything picks up rapidly as the seaso gets much more aggressive. The pre-merge on the whole is saved by ""live tribals"" and a couple of standout personalities/conflicts.

The post-merge is strategy heavy and filled with a lot of friendly characters, but also a lot of characters that fail to make a real imprint on the season beyond their roles. The game is hard to predict and has some amazing episodes. Beyond that, the game stays unpredictable from the beginning of the merge far into finale night. 

Due to a cast of dedicated fans, MvGX steers itself from combining boring strategy w/ boring characters, and instead focuses on characters that help elevate the season and focuses on its own fair share of ""big moves"" (for better and for worse). With that said, the structure of the cast means that the season is far more ""meta"" than your typical survivor season. In some regards, it is true that MvGX is ""Cambodia with newbies"": a strategically flashy season supplemented with emotional elements. 

MvGX plays a dangerous balancing act between making the viewer want to root for everyone, and making the viewer not care who wins whatsoever.

This cast is interesting because it's highly competitive, but also composed of some of the kindest and most thoughtful people to play the game. There's no villain to fight against, and that's okay!

Almost everyone is given a great story, especially the late-gamers. No one is a clear-cut hero or villain, and that actually works in it's favor. Most people are complex characters who you can decide whether you want to win or not. Survivor is at it's worst when the show force-feeds you a favorite to root for. It is at it's best when it gives you multiple people to watch, and lets you decide who is your favorite.

My only complaint is that MvGX is a slow burn. The premerge was rather average, but the postmerge was spectacular.

Granted, they may have felt the same way no matter what, but I can't help but feel like you're sort of setting yourself with false expectations by watching the modern, frenetic, hyper-meta and strategic seasons first. It increases the likelihood that new people in the fandom will see past seasons as irrelevant flim flam that doesn't really have much of a purpose now that it's evolved to a ""better"" show. Which kind of sucks when you want to have discussions crossing the full breadth of Survivor History. 

/u/DabuSurvivor once made a really apt comparison between Survivor and Pokemon that I'm going to steal and bastardize a little. Basically, you can see that people treat the Old, Mid and New Schools of Survivor almost as if they are Pokemon in an evolution chain ala Squirtle, Wartortle and Blastoise. The key difference is that Squirtle was designed from the very beginning by GameFreak with the intention that it would eventually become Blastoise. Borneo was not made with the intention that it would eventually become Game Changers. (Borneo is more like a Porygon--designed originally as a single stage with new evolutions added later on. But I digress.)

Newer fans, especially those who start with later seasons, are more likely to view old seasons as Squirtles. They see them as a stepping stone to Blastoise, as opposed to individual entities with their own unique, strong qualities. They might catch them for the PokeDex Data, but probably won't take them out of the PC after that.

33.0,MvGX,dblmal2,"> Someone who gets hooked because of the frenetic strategy, constant power shifts and meta-awareness of the show and its fandom might feel let down when they go back to watch old-school or even middle-school Survivor where these features are significantly rarer and the story arcs are usually more of a slow burn.

Can confirm. Started with S33, and went back and have been watching from the start. I'm on S9, Vanuatu right now. I do find some of the storylines and episodes rather drawn out and not as intense and strategy focused as the most recent season. However, I do think Seasons 1-8 are some sort of cultural phenomenon, and would recommend any new viewer to start from the beginning (If they have the time/desire to binge watch survivor all the time like I do).

33.0,MvGX,dblms6e,"considering what he had to go through and after watching the reunion, it is kinda sad that you think that. not to mention the winner played a really solid game, definitely better than the people they sat in F3 with. One runner up was a great old school player but got over shadowed by the meta survivor play that this season saw so much of, and the other runner up was definitely a strong player but was very under the radar at times. have your opinions but i definitively think it was a well deserved win",5
33.0,MvGX,dez3n8v,"Personally, I started with Borneo (Season 1) and almost didn't continue. Parts of it were boring to me, and the whole thing felt very slow, with very little strategic play. Now that I've seen 20+ seasons ranging from old to new, though, I am really glad I took the time to watch Borneo. As others have mentioned, it is highly referenced by every other season and to truly understand where the gameplay of survivor was established, you have to watch this season. 

However, I think if I were recommending a season to someone who hadn't seen any Survivor before, I would not recommend starting with Borneo. It just doesn't ""hook"" people the way some of the newer seasons can, in my opinion. I think a season like 25 (Philippines) or Cagayan would be great seasons to start with. ",5

1.0,Borneo,dbjmla9,"Start here. Whatever you do, start here. This season lays the foundation for every season to come and gets referenced a few times in the rest of the series.

It's a slow season compared to modern stuff and the game itself is pretty basic, but this season has a great cast of developed characters and perfect arcs. 

I don't have much to say because you need to watch it yourself. So... you know, go watch it.

**Grade: A**",45
1.0,Borneo,dbju5wp,"I super strongly recommend that people start with this season and watch in order (even if not watching *every single* season.)

Honestly, I kinda have a problem with the question of ""I want to watch old seasons - so which ones are the best?"" Not that I blame people for asking it, or for answering it (hell, I'm answering it myself in this thread) - but I just don't agree with the idea that watching based on which ones people say are ""the best"" is the best idea. And here's why:

* **There really is no objective ""the best"":** different people like and dislike different seasons, and **you don't know who you're going to agree with** until you watch them. There are probably some general trends, true, like odds are season twenty-two isn't going to be your favorite, and you're prooobably going to like season four more than season twenty-four. But outside of the super extreme examples of really, really popular and unpopular seasons - as far as the middle, *most seasons,* go - opinions vary wildly (and they even do at the extremes for some people.) So if you say ""Hey, which seasons are the best?"", you're really just asking ""Which seasons happen to be popular among the people in this particular community who decided to look at and contribute to this particular thread?"" - which might not be indicative of what you'll end up agreeing with. (Although this thread's visibility and massive activity could mediate this problem by providing a broad consensus, if you want a consensus.)

* **I think it's kind of a spoiler in itself to say ""Oh this season is great! It's so unpredictable!""** Then you go into that season knowing that the dynamics are probably going to change at some point, that there'll be a major blindside of the person who seems to be in power or whatever. If you go in having no idea what'll happen either way, having no idea what people think and why, then it'll be the ultimate state of unspoiled-ness - you'll be a totally unspoiled blank slate. And then when you end up watching one of the really freaking crazy seasons, you'll be like :OOO because you had no idea that they were going to be an unpredictable one. When you watch a season live as it airs, you have virtually no idea whether it'll be good or bad; watching in an objective chronological order that isn't defined by ""good"" or ""bad"" recreates this aspect of the experience as much as possible.

* Context enhances every single season. Every single season is more powerful, for better or worse, when you can compare it to those that came around and came before it. **This is especially prevalent in the earliest seasons:** watching season 18 before season 17, when new kinds of strategy and dynamics have pretty much been locked down, probably won't matter that much. But watching season 26 before season 2 definitely does; even watching season 4 before 3 does.

* **The early seasons are a really different show than the most recent ones,** and you'll probably **enjoy that show more if you watch it first**... and enjoy the more recent show more if you've seen the previous seasons that laid its foundation. (This isn't to say ""Oh, the show was kind of okay at first but then it got REALLY good! So watch the mediocre early ones before you get spoiled by how great the show eventually is!"" or anything like that; I personally think all the best seasons were the earliest ones. But they're good in a kind of way that's sometimes harder to appreciate when you're only accustomed to later ones.)

If you're *totally* sure that you're not going to watch a bunch of Survivor and you're just into it more casually (which probably isn't the case for many people spending their time looking at a thread on here), and if you're gonna watch a few seasons then check out, then maybe it makes more sense to go with some of the most popular ones (although even then, for my money, 1/3/4 and 7 are the best in the franchise... but, of course, that's just my opinion.) Even then, though, I'd say whichever ones you're going to watch, it probably makes sense to watch them in order.

But **if you have any interest in *really* getting into the franchise,** if you think that there's *any* chance that you might get really into the show and watch most or all of its seasons to date? Then you should definitely, *deffffinitely* go for the full, chronological order that enhances every season, doesn't give you pre-conceived notions, and helps you really understand the development of the franchise.

And **even if you're only gonna watch a few seasons, I can't really think of any reason *not* to try the first one first.** As I'm gonna outline in just a sec, I think it's pretty fucking gr8 even on its own. If you don't enjoy it and you were looking for something more like the recent seasons, well, no loss, you can move on to them - but if you do enjoy it, then you can keep watching the older ones that most people appreciate more when they're watched earliest.

So for sosososo*soooo* many reasons, I think that everyone who thinks there's *any* chance of themselves really getting into the show should watch every season in order - or at least watch in order what they are going to watch. And I think that even people who won't get too into the show should at least start with 1.

* * *

Now, even aside from all of that - moving past the broader thoughts I have on how to watch, and tackling this season specifically:

Even as a standalone viewing experience and leaving aside all the context and stuff, for those who might not watch much of the show? I still think this season is *totally* a **must-watch** one. It isn't just some weird dull historical thing that you should watch for the sake of enjoying later seasons more, at all; it's some fucking fantastic television, and **if I had to pick just one season to show somebody, and they'd never see any other season ever, I would, utterly without question, pick this one.** Its story plays out in a brilliant way that's told beautifully, and along the way you get some of the biggest, best, funnest, most memorable moments and scenes of the franchise to date - culminating in perhaps the single biggest and greatest moment in the entire history of the show.

**The cast is absolutely fantastic, too.** Keep in mind that the show wasn't a show yet; there was no indication of whether it'd be popular at all or, if so, among whom, so they put together a *remarkably* diverse cast here of people from all kinds of backgrounds who are all entertaining and interesting for a number of reasons - and then **they give each one a complete story.** There are none - none! - of the underedited characters you get in some later seasons. Every single person is built up, and you'll remember every single one when they go out (some of the earliest boots don't have *huge* stories, but nobody's outright neglected), and none of them are really given one-note ""villain"" edits.

I chose to include the ""Watch every season in order! And if you aren't watching every season, you should still watch in order!"" stuff here because I guess season one is the best place to put it, as opposed to a new top-level comment, and it's something I feel strongly about and wanted to express. But I know that some people still might not be interested in that for one reason or another, and they will want to just go with the ""highlights"" or ""best seasons"", so in my other comments I will explain which ones I think are the biggest ""must-watch"" seasons even if you aren't going to watch all of them and what their strong points are. Well, **the original ""Survivor"" is a *massive* strong point from the very beginning up through the very end, and absolutely the one must-watch to end all must-watches, even if you're not going to watch any other seasons.** There's a reason it managed to score *51.7 million viewers* (!!!) in the span of just a few months. Popularity doesn't always mean good, but in this case, it transfixed people for a reason.

I think anyone who has *any* interest in US pop culture or television should watch this, absolutely without question - or anyone who enjoys watching things, because it's so damn good. So certainly, *certainly* anyone who's interested in the franchise that it eventually launched should absolutely, absolutely watch this brilliant television experience. Seriously, this is just... amazing, the original ""Survivor"" is fucking incredible. **It's so fucking satisfying and fulfilling that I don't even know where to begin; the entire product, start to finish, is utterly phenomenal.** Everyone ever should watch it, *especially* fans of this series.

**My Personal Ranking:** 1/32.

**Overall verdict:** Even if you aren't watching every season, or going chronologically for the ones you are watching, I would still strongly, strongly recommend watching this one as soon as you can. Magnificent television.",28
1.0,Borneo,dbjo24y,"This is probably the season I'd recommend starting with.  It's a fantastic season that hasn't got worse with age.  

One of the all-time best casts in Survivor history, possibly the best.  The cast is the thing that makes this season really great.  There's a reason why many Survivor archetypes exist, and it's because characters from Borneo made those archetypes.  And there's a couple of characters that didn't make archetypes because there will never be a character like them.

The season had some amazing moments too, both from a character standpoint and a gameplay standpoint.  If you're looking for advanced gameplay, Borneo is not the place to find it.  However, Borneo set the rules that the rest of Survivor would follow, and the reactions of the players to these rules are very interesting.  One player in particular basically codified the basic way people still play today.

Overall, this is probably the season I'd recommend starting with first.  There's a reason why it was one of the biggest television events of the 21st century, and possibly of all time.",13

Borneo is so different and so unique compared to other seasons, it’s like a completely different experience. The other seasons were just going through the motions, producing the next installment in a line of successful installments, but this one had to be a lot bigger than that. It set the groundwork and invented the entire concept for the show, which is awesome, but because of that, there is some stuff that feels awkward and boring. Still, as a standalone product, there is so much rawness and realness here, as well as an incredible cast, great editing, and some of the most iconic moments not only in Survivor history, but in television history. If you want to watch all of the seasons eventually, this is the only real choice to start with, but even if you don't, it's an absolute must-watch for any true Survivor fan. This is the one that started it all and deserves to be mentioned up with some of the best.

1.0,Borneo,dbjvu7y,"Where it all began. 

Borneo is very different than any other season of Survivor. It is edited almost like a documentary, and as a result, you get to know every single member of the cast very well. And there are many fun, legendary characters. The strategy itself isn’t very exciting, but since it is the first season, you get the see the first strategies and the first alliance in Survivor history form, which is very cool to experience. 

If you’re new to the show, season 1 is a great place to start, then go in chronological order from there. I myself kinda wish I had done this to see the evolution of the show as the years progressed. If you are already a Survivor fan, I highly recommend you go back and watch Borneo to see Survivor’s fascinating origin story.

1.0,Borneo,dbjx1vl,"Obligatory start here because it's the first season, but it really is a true statement. Other shows wish they could have hit the jackpot in their first season like Survivor did, and I do truly feel that this season has withstood the test of time excellently. The great thing about watching this season first is that the first time viewer learns the game along with everybody else that's actually playing it. There's several oddball strategies that contestants experiment with that try to help them advance further, and it's wonderful.

The cast is one of the best ever, and this was before the time where uninteresting characters were forgotten in the edit. No character is under-edited, and this is one of the few casts where I can name off every single person in the game without even thinking about it. There's just so much to love, leading to one of the absolute best finale episodes in the entire franchise.

Absolutely check this one out, don't be scared that it's ""old-school"", it's worth it.",5
1.0,Borneo,dbjrduw,"I'm not in the ""watch them all in order or else"" camp, but this is by far the best starting place unless you're already familiar with  the conventions of the show.

1.0,Borneo,dbjx0vl,"I know a lot of fans who didn't start at the beginning and watch in order who very much wish they had if they could go back and do it over again. Because of that, my personal recommendation will always be to start here and go forward in order, especially for the first 8 seasons. 

The season we call ""Borneo"" now was just ""Survivor"" then. If this season hadn't been so massively successful we still wouldn't be here 17 years later talking about this show. 

If you've seen a couple of newer seasons and are looking to get into the older ones, then prepare yourself for something that will feel incredibly different from any other season of Survivor. Production was figuring out how to make their show while the contestants were discovering how to play the game. If you have an appreciation for Survivor strategy, definitely watch Borneo. The game won't be as fast paced as it is now, but watching as the game is built and discovered is its own reward. And it's especially exciting to watch it come from a cast that, 32 seasons later, still can lay claim to being one of the best groups of castaways ever assembled. If you can't find someone on this season to pull for or be engaged by, I don't know what to tell you.

A lot of fans who get into Survivor later on have a hard time with the older seasons. They find it harder to get into the pacing or the less consistent application of strategic thinking. You aren't going to get what you're used to--but that doesn't mean you won't like what you do find. The only way to know is try for yourself.",4
1.0,Borneo,dbjz537,"First off, I have to say that, if you’re thinking about getting into Survivor and haven’t watched any seasons yet, this is ABSOLUTELY where you should start. Borneo delivers on all the fronts that I think a Survivor season should deliver on: it has a tremendous, colorful, and memorable cast; a complex, multifaceted story; a deep exploration of social dynamics and relations; and a decidedly “old-school” vibe to the whole thing that I think is just wonderfully nostalgic and fun. Borneo made Survivor a national phenomenon for a reason; if you haven’t seen it, you need to check it out immediately. Possible negatives for this season: the editing and the overall pace is slower compared to more “modern” seasons. There’s less of a focus on cutthroat strategy (indeed, at many times, strategic gameplay is admonished). And, of course, those who started on later seasons might get frustrated with the cast’s unwillingness to play hard and be manipulative. ",4
1.0,Borneo,dbkarah,"Truly uncomparable to any other Survivor season. The core Survivor format is there but you just about may as well be watching two different shows.

This really was must-see TV and kickstarted the reality tv boom. If not for Borneo, all of TV is changed today.

Watch this, for sure.

1.0,Borneo,dbkctap,"Great season. Start with this, this is where Survivor started, so if you want to see the whole run from the beginning, here's where to start. 

Its not really all that slow I think, but I'm not a fan of the super-fast paced Cambodia seasons anyways. The characters are very well developed, you know all about them, and who they are. Its a unique season, its the start for everyone, no one knows what they are doing, but it set the mark for every season to follow. 

It has iconic moments, the cast is really good, and while the strategy is basic, its good enough that the strategy isn't boring. I don't really find it boring ever, all of it is pretty interesting. Its a strong season, and even as the first, can match up against any other season and fair pretty well. 

note: I mean, if you're a super modern strategy fan, you can't expect it'll be the same at the beginning. I found it really good, right off the bat, but if you're used to the new, fast paced stuff, its really a different show that's evolved into what it is today. 

**Rank- 8/33**, its really amazing and compelling stuff. Would be my top choice to recommend. ",5
1.0,Borneo,dbkmsak,"In a thread called ""What season should you watch?"" I think that the first season of Survivor is without question the one you should watch first. I made the mistake of not watching it first, therefore skewing my perspective and..... I didn't quite like it as much as I should.

Don't get me wrong. It's an absolute masterpiece of television and it blew up for a reason, but I just don't quite like it as much as most people do, or as much as many other seasons. It's still an amazing season nonetheless, as it started it all. There are zero underedited characters. Some of the players are still some of my favorites of all time.

This season's gameplay is entirely rudimentary, so if you're looking for #STRADERGEE, look away. But then again, do you expect complex strategy from the first season of Survivor? I wouldn't. Plus, that strategy is still fundamental to the show, and each and every winner owes the first winner for what they did to the franchise. Took it from a survival show to a show about survival of your peers.

Looking back, it's a little cheesy and a little dated. It is definitely a huge part of not just Survivor, but American culture. If you look back, it's still a great season, but just not one that I like as much as some others.

1.0,Borneo,dbk6ro1,"I’m going to go against the majority here and say that you **SHOULD NOT** start with this season first and I’m going to explain exactly why.

1. The first season I ever watched was Season 28 – Cagayan and I’m absolutely certain that have I started with Borneo, I would not be here writing this post right now and I might not have even got into Survivor in the first place. The first thing I did after finishing Cagayan was to go back and watch from the beginning, starting with Borneo. I have to say, it took me at least four or five episodes to get into the season and that didn’t really happen with the seasons after it. For example, I found Australia to be a lot easier to watch than Borneo so it can’t even be the fact that I didn’t like old school seasons in general because that is not true.

2. Borneo has very little to do with what Survivor is about right now. Let’s say you watched the Season 33 Finale and then went back to watching the first episode of the first season, they couldn’t be anymore different. I’m not saying that if you are a casual of a newbie that you should never watch Borneo at all but I think that it is a pretty bad pick for a first season. 

3. Most people are not superfans of Survivor, therefore what you appreciate about the show might be completely different for a first-time watcher. For example, I see where you are coming from when you say that a first time should start with watching Borneo first, however I think it makes sense to show a first-time viewer a more dynamic season and then go back to Borneo. 

With that said, Borneo has one of the best casts in the show’s history and there are no “purple edits”, ( players who get dramatically less screentime than others ) therefore you get to know each and every one of the cast members really well. 

Two of my favorite players to ever play the game are from Borneo and I still find their dynamic duo to be one of the most interesting relationships in the show’s history. If you like character development, you are definitely going to enjoy this season.

Keep in mind, that this was the very first season of the show. Everything has evolved or completely changed since the first season so while it’s interesting to see the evolution of the game itself, if you do decide to watch this season first you should be aware that this season is only the beginning and every season gets more strategic in a sense. Overall, I still agree that if you plan on watching every season, Borneo should be one of the first 5 seasons you watch but I wouldn’t recommend it being the first one.

Overall Ranking: **18/33**

A very character-driven season and it will probably take you the first couple of episodes to get into it more but it is a very enjoyable season if you manage to take yourself back to the year 2000 and just enjoy the ride.

* Character wise, the final 5 is really good and provides an entertaining finish to the season.

* Most of the bigger characters of the season are tv gold.

**Negatives**

* The early merge is a slog to get through on a rewatch, since most of the episodes are built on false suspense.

* The editing tries to sell a bit of a false narrative with the winner

* 3 players gets most of the focus by the editors post merge

28.0,Cagayan,dbkowz4,"Survivor: Cagayan is a perfect season of Survivor.

This season has everything you could ever possibly want in Survivor. It opens with the best premiere episode of all time. The pre-merge then continues to be absolutely wild with one of the strangest and most entertaining tribes ever, the most energetic and entertaining player of all-time, and a legendary villain. By the time the merge hits, you think the season can't get any better, but it does. The merge episode features the best tribal council in Survivor history. The very next episode features an insane idol hunt. For the rest of the post-merge, there is an amazing battle between 2 very complex and likable players. Innovative straggles are pioneered. One player becomes one of the best to ever play the game. And lest you worry it's all about strategy, there are plenty of hilarious character moments too.

The characters this season are amazing. Every single player is memorable and well-developed. The winner is phenomenal and his/her game is constantly referenced.

My goodness, I could praise this season all day. I think I've probably said enough now to convince you this is a fantastic season if you haven't seen it. One more thing: the finale is, in my opinion, the best Survivor episode of all time.

My Ranking: **1st / 33**

Best season of television I have ever seen.",6
28.0,Cagayan,dbk646w,"Good, but a lot of its charm comes from how unorthodox it is. Don't start with it, now.",3
28.0,Cagayan,dbk56v1,"Don't start with it, but this is definitely the point *Survivor* turned back into a legitimately good show.

This is definitely the most shocking finale of the post-HvV era, and not just because of what happens on Day 38.",3
28.0,Cagayan,dbk71gw,"This season is fun, it's fast, it's riotous, and features a couple of larger than life personalities that entertain every second they're on the screen. It's chaos, but it's controlled chaos; you never feel lost, and you always understand why the wind is blowing the way it is. It's a **very** new school season, with lots of strategic talk and strategic focus. If you love the strategy, Cagayan is going to be candy to you; if you love the character, while it does have some really dynamic character interactions (particularly early in the season), it's a bit more muted and less rich than other seasons, though not slacking by any right. I really enjoy it, personally.",3
28.0,Cagayan,dbkbfes,"Cagayan definitely has some things going for it.  It is extremely well casted, and its clear that casting was thinking about how the people they casted were going to interact with each other, not just finding great people to cast.  The personalities mesh well together to form great friendships and entertaining rivalries, particularly on the starting tribes.  The first few episodes are really entertaining and hectic and great for drawing a new viewer in.

That being said I’m not a huge fan of it.  There is a whole lot of pointless strategy talk, especially in the mid-merge portion of the game.  This pointless strategy talk is headlined by two people, both of whom I like as casting choices but not as consistent strategy drones.  Their obscene amount of airtime cuts into some airtime that could have been used for the rest of the cast, which is excellent as I mentioned earlier.

I don’t think this season is a good one to watch for a newbie for one simple reason: the winner’s story is portrayed in a false way that gives off the wrong idea of how to win Survivor.  Even the winner says that key parts of their game were left out.  If you do decide to watch this season first, make sure that you look up some post-game interviews with the winner where they talk about the finer details of their strategy.

28.0,Cagayan,dbjrcoq,Most would agree that this is the best season post-Heroes vs Villains. It's an incredibly entertaining season but it may be best to hold off until you've watched the earlier seasons,2
28.0,Cagayan,dbjrzoy,"Cagayan is a sort-of Survivor Renaissance. After a long, dark period filled with universally disliked seasons and endless returnee seasons, this one brought all-new players once again and it reinvented the game with its strategy. Because of that, I think you should watch the previous seasons beforehand so you have a greater appreciation for just how great an impact this season had on the show. ",2
28.0,Cagayan,dbjvy9f,"If you wanna get hooked on, or hook someone on Survivor, Cagayan is a fantastic season to watch. Flashy, unpredictable gameplay the entire way through. With big characters, fun moments, and plenty of big movez, this is universally regarded as one of the best seasons ever. And I mostly agree. Some characters do get the shaft with the edit, and the post-merge loses some of its luster on a rewatch.

But, all things considered, this season is great for a first season for someone or a twenty-eighth. Watch Cagayan. You won’t regret it.
",2
28.0,Cagayan,dbk7mcc,"This is a season of highs and lows. There's great highs of great drama, entertainment, strategy and characters, but the lows just become repetitive episodes of similar strategic plays, focused on a few specific characters. Sure, give more airtime to more entertaining people, but don't overdo it to the point where we've seen them so much it becomes repetitive/not entertaining. Its not slow, like, ever, fast paced. 

Also, feeling no better than it than I did Caramoan on a first watch doesn't help its case. 

**Rank- 20/33**, in the middle of my tier where a lot of the very liked, but very strategic focused seasons lie. 

Would not recommend early on, everything else will feel slow. I think slow to fast works much better. ",2
28.0,Cagayan,dblw9zn,"Cagayan was near universally beloved at the time when it aired. Survivor was slowly crawling it's way out of the Dark Era and needed a rocket boost to send it sailing back into the sunlight, and Cagayan accomplished that task in spades. The premiere is one of the best in the series history and from that point on you'd be hard pressed to find someone in the fandom who wasn't firmly strapped in for the ride.

A few years down the road, some of its glitter has certainly faded, and the season now has a much more mixed response. Some people love it just as much as they did when it aired, others find that with time and distance its flaws have really revealed themselves. The greatest weakness of Cagayan is that as the cast size dwindles, a few key characters really start to swallow the bulk of the airtime, and your response to these characters is very likely to impact how you feel about the season. 

That being said, I know this is a season that hooked a lot of people. If you want cutthroat gameplay and strong strategists in a fast paced game, I can guarantee you now that you're going to love this season. I personally wouldn't recommend starting here, however, because you're going to blow your load at the start, so to speak. If you're a serious fan of Survivor Strategy, you will probably find that very few prior seasons are going to satisfy you like Cagayan, so do yourself a favor and save this treat for dessert. ",2
28.0,Cagayan,dbjnnzl,"Great season, but don't start here.",2
28.0,Cagayan,dbjoze5,"I would strongly recommend **NOT** starting with this season as your first. Not that it’s a bad season or anything, I do like it. But I also think parts of it are very misleading about what Survivor is about. It’s very hyperactive and strategy-based, and it has a very unconventional winner in terms of editing style whose story was told in a bit of a misleading way, and I think because of that starting here would give a viewer a bad idea of what it typically takes to do well in Survivor. I think China and Kaoh Rong do a much better job of combining old-school principles with new-school editing styles.

As for my options on Cagayan itself… the premerge was fantastic with one of the greatest trainwrecks of a tribe of all time, lots of memorable voteoffs, good character moments and just tons of hilarious stuff in general. It also has one of the best casts of the last 5 or so years. After the merge, however, the editing really takes a sharp turn, shifting the main focus onto two players; one of whom I like as a personality, but am not a fan of their story, and the other who has tons of huge fans and tons of huge haters who I don’t really care about either way. Also, one postmerge twist is just absolutely horrendous and never, ever should have happened. Still, it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end, and if you love strategy talk and the two aforementioned characters, it will probably wind up in your top 5. As it is, I think it’s a pretty fun season, but not one of the best, and not a very good starting point.

Proceed with caution.",1

Like it or not it's worth a watch, but again, just don't be expecting the best season of all time. ",1
28.0,Cagayan,dbkl5a9,"I just finished Cagayan probably half an hour before I wrote this comment, so it's very fresh in my mind. I went in knowing the winner(hanging out around here and browsing survivor wiki tends to do that to you!), and even still I felt that the season as a whole was exhilarating and great fun to watch. There's a lot of aggressive gameplay by one player in particular which gave this season a lot of its appeal for me. By the way, the merge episode is sick and probably my favorite episode out of the six seasons that I've seen. I highly recommend Cagayan.",1
28.0,Cagayan,dbklcq5,"I don't think this season's nearly as great as it gets credit for on here: has some way dull stretches, too many forgettable contestants, regrettable twists, and I think the two major characters - and the amount of focus they sometimes get - are often very frustrating.  With something like Cambodia, I can get why people like it more than I do if they're watching for different things, and I can get that for *some* of the episodes here, but for the most part I don't understand the utterly massive hype.

Regardless, I definitely **would not start here.** I don't think any overall aspect of this season stands out compared to other seasons, and it has a lot more weaknesses, and aside from all that, the way this season's presented is misleading in ways that I think could misinform a new viewer as to how Survivor typically works - and it's generally is *so* ""modern"" (which is not the same thing as ""good"" and ""exciting"") that it really misrepresents the show. Plenty of reasons not to start here.

If you're not going chronologically, you'd be better served starting with a Gabon or China or Kaoh Rong that *blends* newer *and* older stuff (and are less misleading.) Additionally, SJDS and especially Kaoh Rong manage to do what people say this season does right while not really falling into any of its same mistakes. SJDS has the blood vs. water twist that may make it a weird starting point, so I'd definitely suggest Kaoh Rong as a direct alternative (though Kaoh Rong also spoils this season's winner, which is why things get weird when you go out of order.)

If you just want to know what Survivor is like right now and aren't as interested in going back and watching previous seasons, then this would be a *decent* place to start, but I think you'd be better served with a season like SJDS, KR, or MvGX, which do contain all modern elements while also including some elements of older seasons, and with less dead space are seasons I think easily surpass Cagayan overall.

**My Personal Ranking:** 21/32

**Overall verdict:** In addition to being a season I think is really lackluster overall, it's *so* ""modern"" with such an anomalous winner that I don't think it's a good introduction to the show. There are multiple other recent seasons that are less misleading, less exclusively ""modern"", and better seasons anyway.",1
28.0,Cagayan,dbky0il,"A lot of people here will tell you how great Cagayan is and how you should start with it.  I fundamentally disagree.  If you have never seen a Survivor season, Cagayan is a **horrible** place to start.  Cagayan is a season that is ridden with twists that will confuse someone who has never seen the show.  It's not a season that explains what is going on, it assumes knowledge of past seasons and past mechanics, and is therefore inaccessible to someone who doesn't have that background.

With that being said, Cagayan is a really fun season, with two really fun starring characters and some smaller characters who, while not being A+, help the season by being put in interesting circumstances.  There's a lot of funny moments and some fun bits even from these minor characters.",1

It gives the origin to one of the Internet’s favorite players ever, and tons of other fantastic characters as well. Once you get past the merge, seemingly every player becomes a power-hungry jackass, and everyone starts acting like high school friends one day, turning around and stabbing each other in the back the next day. And this creates a very unique atmosphere that makes it very fun to watch, and the general vibe of the season is a very, very enjoyable one. In general, t's often compared to having the vibe of a high school movie, and I can see the comparison there, so maybe that'll help you get an idea of how much you'll like it going in.

Also, this season was the first to have modern Survivor strategy, so if you're looking for that, Amazon is a good place to start.

The season's also kinda weird in the ways that the producers had so much fun with it, they had thought bubbles, two people in one confessional, and even James Bond-esque music shows up at one point. Stuff like that doesn't occur so much that it's ridiculous though.

For me, personally, I developed such a healthy hate for all the personas in the first half that I found it difficult to care about their success or failure towards the end.

I had seen Amazon probably 5 times by the time I got my best friend into Survivor, so when we got to Amazon I was very used to everything in the season just kind of, you know... being how it is. She, on the other hand was mortified and really turned off by a lot of the men, especially the season's most prolific contestant (though via RHAP she has now changed her tune). I'd guess that a lot of the fans who don't find much of an issue with the rampant sexist humor and frequent objectification of women are probably, well... not women. ",4
17.0,Gabon,dbjnz72,"Gabon is a pure comedy, and it... is... AMAZING! If you've ever seen Total Drama, this is pretty much that show without the gross out humor. It's random, it's weird, it's full of cartoony people and a really bizarre boot order, almost like someone tried to make a high budget parody of the show.

Most of the characters are memorable for something, usually something hilarious (such as just going missing, gobbling for no reason, or fighting over a cookie to name a few). There are a lot of deliciously dumb conflicts going on that are petty beyond belief, and they are a blast to watch. Everyone hates each other and it's played 100% for laughs.

On a more serious note, the location is my favorite location ever. Gabon has a gorgeous landscape right out of a piece of art and every challenge uses it well. The wildlife is also prominent to a point and there's one nature scene early on that is truly amazing, but you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Overall, Gabon is great blast of comedy and kooky characters that acts as candy among the savory meat of standard Survivor classics. It's a must watch, especially if you just need a quick laugh.

17.0,Gabon,dbjm9iq,"A very character-centric, unconventional season. The cast is full of one of a kind people who arent necessarily likable, but interesting to watch.

Its kind of like if all the people who were meant to go premerge somehow banded together and took over a majority of the season.

Personally, Gabons my top five, but if you want to watch a season with good strategists and gameplay, lol don't watch Gabon. No one *really* knows what their doing, but they just do it anyways. ",17

Don't watch this season if you want everyone around you to fit the lovable heroic archetype. Do watch this season if you want to see a bunch of wacky people doing wacky things in a wacky place with wacky elephants, in a way that will (for better or for worse, but mostly for better) leave you scratching your head the entire way.",3
17.0,Gabon,dbjuot6,"A lot of the comments will call Gabon a ""trainwreck season"" or ""weird"", but I disagree. I think it might be more accurately described as a **cartoon,** full of funny, colorful contestants hurting themselves in silly ways. And furthermore, the season's core narrative and winner are really, *really* satisfying for a first-time viewer. I think part of what makes Gabon great is that it works on two levels: you can pay attention to it deeply with more knowledge of the franchise and see how fucking unorthodox some of its stuff is, or you can just watch it not knowing much about the show, find someone to root for, and be happy with how it ends.

But what really makes Gabon great is that the cast is just fucking **FUN** - and edited well. This cast is actually my third-favorite in Survivor history, after Borneo and Marquesas.. so basically, I think this season is actually totally on par with some of the earliest seasons in terms of how its story is told and how character-driven it is. It has a lot of new-school stuff in terms of twists and strategy discussion, but I think it's at heart kind of an old-school season whose focus is really on the personalities and how they interact. There are SO many little character moments that I end up catching more I'd forgotten about or never noticed every single time I watch it, and I've seen it like 4 or 5 times by now.

In that sense, **I think that this season perfectly blends older and newer Survivor,** and **this** season is **definitely the one that I'd recommend to start with if Borneo doesn't work for you.** I think it's very much at home with the original 7 while clearly containing some elements of the newer seasons, making it an excellent gateway. The other gateway season is China, which is a bit more strategic but I think has a significantly weaker (but still strong) cast and, more troublesome, outright spoils one of the greatest moments ever from Pearl Islands. I would also add Kaoh Rong to the trio of gateway seasons, but it spoils the winner of Cagayan - but I don't think that winner is as big a spoiler as what China spoils about PI. Anyways, though, Gabon is definitely one of those gateway seasons while spoiling nothing.


**My Personal Ranking:** 6/32

**Overall verdict:** Probably the most accessible and fun season Survivor has ever had, due to having some more modern elements while also being driven by a diverse collection of utterly brilliant characters. A really, really good starting point if you're not inclined to start at the original as a great mixture of new and old *without* the problem China has, and I would say it's easily the absolute highlight of modern Survivor.

17.0,Gabon,dbjpawf,"Gabon holds a bit of a special place in my heart. I watched the first few seasons as a kid, but stopped for a while, gave it another shot with this one and have been hooked ever since. And there’s a reason it pulled me in so much; the season is absolutely hilarious. People describe it as a “trainwreck” season, and while I think that’s better used to describe Nicaragua than Gabon, it still summarizes a lot of the things that go down here. The cast is freaking amazing, and epitomizes the idea of coming from different walks of life better than just about any other one. One particular set of partners contains two people who could not be more different in their everyday lives, but they’re a great team here, and Gabon is full of that kind of stuff. There is a twist midway thorough the season that some people don’t like, the cast is fun but not necessarily “likable”, and if you want a season with excellent strategy, you won’t be a fan; there are no top 50 Survivor players in this entire cast. But as far as fun character moments go, it’s hard to do much better than this one.

My one criticism is that there are some cases where the production can be seen as unfair, but it ends up servicing the flow of the season so it's not so bad. ",1
17.0,Gabon,dbjszyb,"Gabon is very similar to Nicaragua in that the main appeal is not strategy, but rather the antics of an insane cast.  While I personally like Nicaragua more, I do really like Gabon.  

One thing that Gabon does really well is the scenery.  This is the first season shot in HD, and it is absolutely beautiful.  Some of the shots in this season could be placed in a nature documentary and I wouldn’t notice.  

You’ll either love this cast for how crazy and inept they are at Survivor, or hate them for the same reason.  I personally love them for it but that’s just me.  The strategy in this season is probably the worst in the history of the show post-Borneo, with one contestant in particular doing things that are too weird to comprehend.  It’s weird that this comes directly after Micronesia, which is far more advanced strategically.  But if you don’t care at all about strategy, then you’ll enjoy the fun craziness that is Survivor: Gabon.

There's not really any sort of strategic mastermind who runs the show; votes often come down to interactions between the characters and naturally a lot of drama is present.

Gabon is not that. There are so many ridiculous characters, the winner and players at the end are incredibly strange and it's very very funny. The boot order is also incredibly unpredictable, because there are so many players with no clue. But this cluelessness works well, unlike in season such as Redemption Island, because the characters distract us from it and are given a lot of time to shine. Also, the location is great. If you like character-based survivor with a lot of humor, this might be a reasonable place to start.

Emotion. Humor. Characters. Story. Editing. Gameplay. Drama. You name it, Vanuatu’s got it. Now admittedly there’s lots of dead weight in the cast in the first few episodes, but that doesn’t mean the premerge is bad; there are a lot of memorable moments and downfall arcs, and some great setup for later on. It really starts to pick up around the merge, the season’s climax is absolute perfection, and it only gets even BETTER as you get towards the end. Seriously, the final few contestants are easily my favorite set of endgamers across 33 seasons and each of them has a very fulfilling arc from beginning to end. It plays out damn near perfectly.

It's the only season of, well, any reality television show that handles a Battle of the Sexes theme in a nuanced and poignant manner rather than a hamfisted one; this is largely due to casting men and women from varied walks of life, rather than casting young people meant to reinforce stereotypes. The postmerge is nail-bitingly tense; these fundamental personality conflicts come out to play, leading to some of the most wrenching blow-ups out there. Every single person who makes it deep gets interesting, fleshed out, unique as hell characterization, and each of them have unique and distinct relationships with everyone else still standing there. Seriously spectacular season.",13
9.0,Vanuatu,dbjqn05,"My favorite season yet, and the ones I have left will likely not top it nor will any future seasons. This season has the best story of any season and it's something you need to see firsthand, unspoiled. 

The early game gets flak for being boring and slow, but that's only when you look back after an amazing post-merge. Both halves of the season are great and the characters are a huge part of that. The final six is pretty much the best final six of all time and everyone there plays a role in shaping the game/story.

The season is a perfect mix of everything good about Survivor, from the brutality to the humor to the joy to the downfalls to the whatever, you name it and Vanuatu has it in spades.

However, after finishing this season,  I sit in awe at how raw and impactful this game can truly be on some of the contestants. Granted, some may find the pre-merge rather lackluster, but there are some truly amazing, cutthroat moments that makes people, including the audience, realize for the first time that this is not just a game with characters, but rather real life people. As the story progresses, the season begins to become excellent, showing Survivor in its rawest form. Many friends are backstabbed, It features the most unlikely alliance, the rise and fall of major characters, and total chaos all the way up to the end. But what truly amazes me is the **Final Tribal Council, which is, out of all of the seasons, one of if not the best**. You see the remaining castaways, and the jury, speak with the rawest and most pure emotions that I have ever seen. Furthermore, this FTC is truly amazing, showcasing the true impact and emotional turmoil that Survivor can bring upon its castaways.

This season aired in a really weird time, being the first season post the original All-Stars (and therefore the first season outside of the initial Survivor Era).

9.0,Vanuatu,dbjuero,"Vanuatu is often a very, very beloved season by those who have seen it, and its fans are very, very loyal - yet somewhat surprisingly, not many fans have seen it. I'm not sure why exactly this season ends up so ""forgotten."" I think it's a very, very good season, though, and definitely one that people should check out. It has some really colorful characters, it has some moments that are *super* unpredictable and satisfying, it has some incredibly complex characters. It has great moral struggles, it has great strategy, it has a bitchin' location complete with volcanoes!!. It has a great and entertaining winner. **It has pretty much everything that you could ever want in a Survivor season. Very, very well-rounded season** with a wide enough pool of characters that you'll almost certainly find someone to like. I don't really have a ton to say on it, particularly without spoiling some of its storylines, except that I think it is quite good at everything, I think it is a very strong addition to Survivor canon, and it is absolutely a season you should watch. I guess the only point against it is that while it's a solid 8/10 in everything, it doesn't always rise to the level of excellence at any one particular thing, but I think the bottom line there is still ""it's a solid 8/10 in everything.""

I will also add that Vanuatu is best described as a ""slow burn"", and not just because ""burn"" creates a bit of a pun with all the volcanoes. If you start it and you're a few episodes in, and you're thinking ""This is okay, but.. why do people love it so much?"", don't worry. Most people don't love it for the first few episodes (though I do think the premiere is pretty great.) It builds and builds, it gets better as it goes, and everything that eventually happens is very much worth the setup. So when you watch Vanuatu, have faith and know that even if you aren't zomgcrazy about the beginning, that doesn't mean it has no chance of being one of your favorites.

**My Personal Ranking**: 12/32, but upon a rewatch, I expect it to probably jump up to 10 or higher.

**Overall verdict**: Of the 9-16 era, I'd probably put Vanuatu second only to Palau as a ""must-watch"" one. It's a super impressive season that does just about everything right and just about nothing wrong, and while I wouldn't pick it right away for someone to watch, it's definitely one that you can watch at pretty much any point in your Survivor viewing career and probably really, really enjoy.

But even if this were one of my absolute favorite seasons, I would ***not*** recommend this season for a new viewer to get into Survivor. Firstly, this is a returning player season, meaning that it features cast members who have already played before in prior seasons, so you'll miss out on some of the growth and development of these players if you haven't seen them the first time around. This season also involves multiple twists that are not seen in most Survivor seasons. One is the titular ""Blood vs Water""--the cast is comprised of 10 returning players, each partnered with a loved one (significant other; sibling; parent/child) on the other tribe. Players have past history with each other via the game (for returning players) and via their lives outside the game (for the Loved One Pairs). Additionally, this is also one of 3 seasons to feature a twist called Redemption Island, in which players voted out of the game head to live at a separate camp where they compete in challenges for the right to re-enter the main game at set intervals. On top of that, when a player is voted out and sent to Redemption Island, their partner (if still in the game) will be given the option to swap spots and go to Redemption Island in their stead.  Given all of these elements, this season has an extremely unorthodox format and is a very poor representative of what most Survivor seasons are like. There are seasons with significantly fewer complexities in the game format that are just as exciting from a character and gameplay angle, so there is no reason to pick this season as one of your firsts.

Water",dbjo1c5,"This season contains returnees that originally appeared on seasons 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19, and 24, each competing with a loved one playing for the first time. Some of the returnees made a future appearance(s) on 8, 20, or both before coming on this season for a third/fourth time. I don’t think watching the previous seasons is a necessity here like it is with All-Stars or HvV, since the storylines are much more focused much more on the returnees’ relationships with their loved ones than on their prior appearances, but I’d still recommend watching at least some of their previous seasons if you want to get the most of it.

Anyway, BvW is OK. I went into this season with the lowest expectations I’ve ever had for a season and was very pleasantly surprised at the time, but as time has gone on it's clear that it isn’t anything all that spectacular. The premerge is very good, and there are a few great moments later on too, but it won’t really wow you on an episode-by-episode basis. Some of the new players are really enjoyable, and it has a pretty popular winner, so I’d definitely recommend watching it at some point, but it’s already become fairly forgotten — and considering it aired only three years ago, that’s not really a good thing. Definitely a really bad choice for a first-time viewer thanks to a whole bunch of twists.

But oh man, that postmerge is booorring. Aside from a rare occurrence at one of the vote offs, one contestant makes it a struggle to watch for me because they never live up to their promises. I enjoy this person's ""tragic story arc"" throughout the postmerge, but it still doesn't redeem it for me.

I honestly don't think I was missing virtually anything. So I definitely don't recommend it. It's not particularly *bad,* but it is very predictable, it is often very frustrating, it is often rather dull, and it contains the RI twist yet again. I think it, along with One World, is the definition of mediocre Survivor, despite two great Tribal Councils along the way. And it wastes a lot of time on pointless, artificial ""suspense"" that leads to a really inaccurate and frustrating story. There's no real reason to dive right into this one - and since half the cast are returning players, the initial twist/tribal division is very unorthodox, and it has another major twist throughout that fundamentally alters every episode, there's a lot of reason not to. Worth watching at some point, but not even in the first half of your Survivor-viewing career. Definitely not as an introduction with all its twists, all of its explicit spoilers for many (superior) previous seasons, and so many better seasons you could pick from instead. Like I'm not saying never watch it since there's some fun stuff going on here, but there's more than enough reason to not prioritize this one.

**My Personal Ranking:** 23/32

**Overall verdict:** Meh and has returning players and anomalous casting with the BvW twist. Not *bad,* but zero reason to put this at the start or anywhere even remotely close to it.

27.0,"Blood vs.
Water",dbjvpes,"
Controversial opinion: Blood vs Water (1) is the far superior season of the two Blood vs Waters. It really should not have worked, but it somehow did. The theme seems gimmicky, but it allows for some really emotional and genuine moments and adds an interesting new wrinkle into the game. It has Redemption Island, but it actually works well here with the theme, in my opinion. 

Pre-merge is not amazing, but it is good and has a fantastic pre-merge villain (yes, I know you hate him/her, but that’s what makes this person a great villain!). Post-merge is really exciting, with a few big moves and lots of suspense. Great and deserving winner, to boot. 

Don’t watch this season first, but definitely watch it eventually. It’s very underrated. Top 10 season for me.

When this season was announced, it was dreaded what it would become, especially since it came off the heels of the panned S22-S24 and S26. It had the most twists of any season (one of which was universally panned in earlier seasons). The cast was a hodgepodge of returnees from earlier seasons with seemingly no rhyme or reason. The new players were all friends/relatives to the returnees. This looked like it had the makings of a Bottom 5 season.

Fortunately, it didn't turn out that way. The editing was surprisingly good. The hated twist (Redemption Island) seemed to add to the season rather than detract from it, at least premerge. This is probably the most positive, upbeat season of all time, other than maybe Australia. It lifted us out of the Dark Ages, and for that I thank it.

29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",dbjn6o2,"San Juan del Sur is a fairly polarizing season. Some people find it boring, cringy, and mostly devoid of characters who are worth investing in. Others (like myself) will tell you that every character has a role in one of the most cohesive and interesting stories that any Survivor season has had. In general, the consensus appears to be that if you're watching Survivor predominately for the strategy and gameplay, then you won't like this season much; but if you're watching predominately for characters and stories, you'll love it. 

Of course, the only way to find out is to watch for yourself. 

**I would *not* recommend Survivor: San Juan del Sur for new or first-time viewers.** The core twist of the season is called Blood vs Water, which means that each contestant has a loved one (significant other; sibling; parent/child) on the opposite tribe and that their pre-existing relationship has the ability to impact the game. This is not standard for Survivor and definitely makes this a poor representative of the ""average"" Survivor season for a potential new fan. It is also, as I said, polarizing, so I'd be more likely to recommend it to someone who has seen a few seasons and has a better idea of what parts of Survivor really catch their interest. ",32
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",dbjr2uq,"**San Juan del Sur was pretty much universally panned by the fanbase when it aired.** 

Perhaps because it was hot on the heels of an incredibly well-regarded season, in a large-scale movement, people just hated this season. Even when the season started to deliver some legendary episodes and blindsides, people still assumed that the season was going to take a turn for the worse and that the magic would run out. 

**I'm here to tell you that the magic doesn't run out.** 

Luckily for you, you won't have to do any speculating or doomsaying on your watch of this season. You can just enjoy the frenetic journey of this very unusual cast as they all attempt to make their way to the top.

**Anyway, so what are some concerns about watching this season?** 

First of all, this is a season of survivor that, even though it contains new players, has a very complex ""blood vs. water"" format, in which each player has a ""loved one"" they know from outside the game on the opposite team. This format makes this season highly different from other seasons of all new casts. It also makes for a more complex game. You'll probably want to watch a normal season before you watch this one. Speaking of the cast, this cast is famously kind of bizarre. When you try to get invested and root for a certain player, you might find some trouble finding one you love depending on what you like. That being said there are some good heroes and wholesome folk to root for and some really hilarious jerks to root against. 

**What's so fantastic about this season?** 

This story. I can't stress enough how close to perfect this season played out. San Juan del Sur has a lot of people playing with their heart, and it shows, and it helps combine the strategy aspect of the show, which makes for excitement, with the interpersonal part of the show, which is what makes the strategy meaningful and beautiful. The ""blood vs. water"" twist adds some great relationships to the characters. There's so many unique and crazy episodes on this season. There's what can only be described as a Ferris Bueller's Day Off-esque episode. There's this really weird moment where everyone in the entire game gets hung up over something extremely stupid, but people care a whole lot about it. There's a second episode with a very similar premise, where a completely mundane reward challenge winds up grinding the entire game to a halt, and everyone plays their part in that ridiculous Rube-Goldberg machine. On top of that, there are episodes that end with colossal blindsides. Each one is carefully built up in this season. From the very beginning, you can see the roles of the characters form, and watch how they slowly move towards their final destination. This season has a very fantastic hero and very fantastic villain. A lot of the time this season is probably spent trying to find out which is which though, and that's the great part. You're not really sure until it's all over. By the time it's over though, you will be very satisfied with the outcome and the beautiful downfalls along the way.

**This is my favorite season.** 

I can't praise it enough. It's a classic story with some classic main characters, and some great supporting characters. While trying to spoil as little as possible, it has something really unique to itself that I think allows us to believe in like, the magic of survivor. It's a generally lighthearted and fun season, that will leave you excited to watch more survivor. I definitely recommend this is you've already seen a handful of other seasons.",31

SJDS’s reputation wasn’t the greatest when it aired, but it has only gone up over time. It’s is a very good season for character development, as it’s one of the few modern seasons where almost all of the characters feel like they have a role in the story — some are more props in the stories of their loved ones than good characters themselves, but either way you do get to know pretty much all of them. The premerge is average at best (save for one amazing episode), but the postmerge is excellent, with some very well-edited blindsides and funny character moments, and a very satisfying and agreeable winner. My main gripes with the season are the return of a twist that led to waaaaay too many immunity idols ending up the players’ pockets, and the attitudes of the players towards the end do support the notion of “you have to make big moves to win Survivor” which I can’t stand, but neither of those hurt the season that much. I wouldn’t recommend starting with it, just because the BvW twist is so complex and gives it a feel that may not be best for a new viewer, but I’d still say it’s a very good season all-around.

Anyways, Palau aside - Guatemala is sort of the forgotten ""black sheep"" of Survivor seasons. It is unique in that it's the only season in Survivor history to introduce no players who would later return - primarily because production just kind of hated filming it - which of course deters newer fans from going back and checking it out, and in and of itself, it doesn't stand out too strongly in any one particular area, so it just... isn't talked about much. It's mostly just talked about for being the season nobody ever talks about.

This might make you think ""Well, it's probably boring, so I'll skip it!"" - but, if you're seriously into the show, you shouldn't. Guatemala has one of the best locations of any Survivor season. One tribe's camp is located in an *actual Mayan ruin!!*, which is so fucking cool! It has some pretty emotional and evocative moments, it has some contestants who remain popular to this day for being funny or just plain likable, it has a decent long-term storyline, it introduces some twists that would become fixtures of later seasons. There's a lot to like here.

Do I think that it's a season I'd instantly recommend to someone? Probably not, because there's better seasons in pretty much any area, and this season does have some notable flaws. Personally, I dislike parts of the boot order and parts of the editing - I think these are most other people's problems as well - but it has a pretty decent cast of characters and a great location that'll make you feel at least fairly rewarded for having sat through it, even if it won't be in your all-time top 3 or anything. (And, hell, maybe it will be in your top 3. I know a fucking DIEHARD Guatemala fan who insists that it's the best of the best of the best of the best. She fucking lives, breathes, bleeds, salivates Guatemala. So, again, you never really know.) But it's a fine season.

Basically if you're watching in order and you want to skip over non-essential seasons, this is probably one you can get away with passing over, but if you only want to skip ""the bad ones"", it's definitely worth watching. Or if you're watching out of order, there's no reason to rush into this, but there's no real reason to leave it til the end, either... so its reputation as ""an average season"" remains pretty accurate, haha.

**My Personal Ranking**: 14/32

**Overall verdict**: That this is considered ""decent Survivor"" just speaks to how strong Survivor is as a show, because this is actually some pretty fucking strong television. But since Survivor is often pretty strong television, even more than this, there's no real incentive to rush into Guatemala compared to the many other strong seasons the show has to offer. But there's no real reason to put it off, either; it's good, other seasons are just even better, so Guatemala ends up as a relatively middle-of-the-road season and the most important thing is just that you don't watch it before Palau.

I recently watched this season and did not really enjoy it. I don't think this season is essential viewing because there is only one player who returns in another [Stephenie LaGrossa in season 20](/spoiler) and even watching for her story is not worth it at all. The gaming is not groundbreaking, there are only a few standouts casting wise, and the winner is under edited so their win is not very satisfying. 

Watch this one after you've seen the essential seasons. It's not a must watch.",1

This season must not be watched before Palau (If you do, go into the corner and feel bad.) The two returnees from Palau have their stories become *much* more fascinating.

I certainly don't dislike it, but I just found it to be a little below average and I found 23 other seasons to be better. The opening challenge was freaking brutal. There are several players who are in contention to win near the end. The winner gave a perfect example of how to win in a certain circumstance.

Guatemala is tragically underrated, most of all by Jeff Probst himself, along with production. There has been only one Guatemala returnee since, and the fanbase has forgotten it.

11.0,Guatemala,dblk0h6,"Well, I feel as I should comment on this because this is my favorite season.  First things first, don't watch this season first, as many have already said.  There's two returning cast members from the previous season (Palau) so if you want to remain unspoiled for that season, don't watch this one before.

Okay, now why do I love this season so much?  Because it has everything to love in Survivor.  Great cast?  Check.  Everyone that makes episode 5 is a great character for different reasons.  Nobody feels exactly the same, and each one gets a story.  Great location?  Check.  Mayan ruins make for the best location the show has seen and give it such a distinct feel.  It's also a more difficult location, so we get a harder season with high temperatures and no way to go in the water (crocs.)  Great plot?  Check.  There's multiple subplots centered around a larger one.  Everyone has a role in some way shape or form during the season.  Everyone.

For people that care more about the strategy, you will not be disappointed.  There's great, bold moves that are planned out.  This is the first season with the Hidden Immunity Idol that would become a staple of the show.  Guatemala's buff colors and other design choices are distinct and beautiful.

So why is this season forgotten?  No cast member from this season has returned.  Why?  The season was when there were less seasons with returnees, so the next returnee season was 5 seasons away, AND was a FvF season, meaning they only needed 10 castaways from a previous season.  Then the next one was HvV, and nobody was remembered enough by that point to be on what was billed as the biggest season the show had ever seen.

Guatemala is an amazing season from start to finish.  Please, if you have not seen it and have seen Palau and maybe another season or two, do yourself a favor and watch it.",1

Suffers on a rewatch since a lot of its best moments depend on unpredictability, but still a pretty entertaining season throughout, with some of the funniest moments in the history of the show (one scene in particular really stands out — and if you’ve seen it you know what I’m talking about). One of the most notorious and popular alliances of all time is found here, as well. The boot order isn't the greatest, and it’s often described as a pretty “shallow” season; fun to watch on the surface, but not a whole lot going on in terms of in-depth characterization. Overall though, it’s a memorable season with plenty of stuff to enjoy — a very good “popcorn season”. Just don’t make it your first one.

Packed of dynamic characters, fantastic moves, hilarious comic relief, and memorable moments.

A vocal minority of detractors give this season a bad rep, but frankly, if you go into Survivor looking for emotion and darkness, this isn't quite the season for you. Maybe watch The English Patient (#SeinfeldReferences).

However, if you watch Survivor for surprises, pure fun, memorable downfalls and fantastic blindsides, go for this season. Your enjoyable will pertain to what exactly you want from Survivor, and if you're watching Survivor for fun/strategy, you'll enjoy Micronesia.

Its a mediocre season for me personally, but a lot of people really like it, so its probably a good season to watch, as you're quite likely to fall within the majority. Definitely unpredictable, strategic, if you like those things, but many characters aren't developed particularly well. It starts a lot of modern trends, if you've watched modern seasons like Cambodia, and enjoyed them, I'd say a lot of the roots of that style come from Micronesia.

16.0,Micronesia,dbjy0wo,"One question I see asked fairly often is ‘where does modern Survivor start’.   For me, modern Survivor starts with this season.

Some people like this change.  I see quite a few place it in their top tier and I know that for many people it is a definitive top five season of all time.  If you were more of a fan of the strategic side of KR and MvGX, this season is for you.

That being said, I’m not a fan.  While I don’t think this season is very bad, it set a lot of trends that would be used in some of Survivor’s worst seasons like an over-reliance on returnees, inconsistent editing and bad twists.

I love a good, explosive blindside, and this season had that reputation as the #BLINDSIDE season for a good long while, but imo, so many seasons have come after it and done the #BLINDSIDE thing better than Micronesia has.

Plus, it's Fans vs. Favorites. The Fans were better than the Caramoan fans, but still had no chance against the returnees. The Favorites had a few bad casting choices, but nothing awful.

3.0,Africa,dbjmh4j,"As the older seasons become more and more outdated, their role as ""essential viewing"" will continue to diminish, which is unfortunate. What the early seasons lack in the new era's fast paced meta gaming and strategy is made up for in storytelling and character richness that is rare to find in the modern era, and Africa is one of the strongest examples. Fans consistently refer to this as the season where the location is the 17th character, and its for good reason. No other setting will ever manage to capture the simultaneous awe-inspiring beauty and heartbreaking desolation of the Kenyan Savannah. The castaways this season truly *suffer* in these elements. 

Beyond the location though, Africa is worth watching for a very strong cast that originate some of Survivor's best character archetypes, and for a game that offers something a little different than the first two seasons as the roles of strategy and morality in the Survivor world continue to be defined. This is also the first Survivor season to feature a ""twist,"" which is one of the season's highlights. 

In the modern era, it's highly unlikely we'll see anyone from this season again, so if you're watching just to prep yourself for Game Changers you don't really need Africa.

The cast is incredibly strong and you will feel an attachment to several of the characters. The location is absolutely amazing, and the cinematography absolutely makes perfect use of it.

3.0,Africa,dbju7xg,"It's often said that in the earliest seasons of Survivor, the location itself was the ""17th player"" or ""17th character."" Nowhere is this truer than season three. Kenya is utterly without question my pick for the best location ever. It's so starkly different from anywhere else they've ever gone that every single second of this season feels so different than any other one - and it's a positive difference, because it's so fucking stunning and gorgeous. They're actually out there in the middle of the savanna, and it's astounding. It really drives home with every single shot that these are 16 Americans dropped off into some other pocket of the world they'd probably never, ever see otherwise, and it's fantastic. This comes into play in some of the challenges and rewards in ways that are nothing short of beautiful. **If anything can make you appreciate the environmental, survival side of Survivor (besides Australia's aptly titled ""No Longer Just A Game"" episode), it's the entirety of this season.**

Aside from all of that, you have some **incredible and colorful characters here**; this may be in my top 5 or so favorite Survivor casts. There are a variety of contestants you'll likely love, love to hate, laugh at, and laugh with. Comic relief, heroes, villains - this season's got a very strong range of characters. It has a couple of the most iconic pre-merge boots ever, it has one of the most respected winners ever, and many characters in between are among the most popular, most unique, and most entertaining the show has ever seen.

This season also features one of the most unprecedented Survivor moments ever a few episodes in, though it is one that, when removed from historical context, may be less shocking to a viewer more acquainted with newer seasons.

Above all else, it's just **an entertaining viewing experience.** I love this season in a way that's hard for me to really put into words, which isn't really a problem I often have. I think it's simply that I utterly adore the location and generally love the cast - I dunno, I just feel excellent watching it. You've got awesome contestants here saying and doing awesome things in an awesome setting, making for an awesome product that I'm very happy is a part of Survivor canon and highly recommend to any and every Survivor fan.

If you're going to dive into old-school Survivor, this is a *great* early season. I don't see why you'd start with it as opopsed to Borneo, but I think it is a big improvement over Australia (both as a starting point and as an overall product), not just because it relies less on context and outside information, but also because it improves upon basically everything about Australia: it has almost as strong of a focus on the wilderness and a personal, emotional development of the contestants, but they also have a bit more color and ""character"" to them with a more dynamic game, more interpersonal drama, and more twists. Australia may be more emotional (and its greatest episode far eclipses any episode from Africa), but this season is still very emotional and is probably more dynamic and more fun.

**My Personal Ranking:** 4/32

**Overall Verdict:** This is a really fun collection of episodes that'll likely leave you really satisfied. Good times. If you spend your time watching it, you'll likely not regret it, and you'll almost definitely come out of it with a few new favorite contestants. If you're watching chronologically, or even semi-chronologically looking only at the highlights, this is definitely another great early season worth checking out. Or if you're watching in a sort of haphazard order without caring about chronology, I'd certainly prioritize this one early as a sometimes hidden but equally lustrous gem of early Survivor with some fantastic characters.",3

This was one of the five or so seasons that I never watched all of until recently when I finished it, and though my expectations weren't low at all, it still exceeded them.

And the man who does that is just one of countless great characters that the season has to offer. I'd say that pretty much everyone besides the first few boots has at least a few wonderful moments that everyone can appreciate. Also if you're more into the strategy, this season has a fair amount of that too, it's not Cagayan or anything and it's not very flashy gameplay, but with the twist introduced in episode 5 (which is something that occurs countless times after this season), talk about throwing challenges or throwing hinky votes, and key power player in the seasons gives you stuff to chew on.

That being said, the actual content of the season is not great, in my opinion. The pre-merge definitely has not aged well with a very cringeworthy story-line that dominates one tribe (albeit one that has a somewhat satisfying ending). Post-merge is better, with some iconic characters and decent strategy for such an early season. And, some VERY hilarious moments, some of the funniest in Survivor history. 

I’d put it middle of the pack, above Australia but below Borneo. I’d recommend watching the first two seasons before watching this one.

The returnees originally come from seasons 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, and 19, and many of them that make their third appearance here are more notable for their second appearance in either 8 or 16, so I would strongly recommend watching those as well.

An immensely popular season at the time and up to today, Heroes vs Villains is pretty much what you’d expect out of an all returnee season. The fireworks fly both before and after the merge, with some of the most memorable moments, conflicts and strategic decisions ever made. Personally, I like it way less than most people; I’m not a big fan of the boot order on either side, a lot of the people I was most excited to see back are underedited, and I find the player who gets the most airtime to be absolutely insufferable. But there’s enough going on around that player to enjoy the season as a whole, and even as someone who likes it less than just about everyone, I’d still say it has countless fun stuff going on from beginning to end. For the love of god though, just don’t watch it first.

This season is everything a 10th anniversary All-Star celebration season should be. It's an over-the-top, balls to the wall smackdown with some of the most important players in Survivor's history (up until that point at least). It's a season that I don't think I've ever seen anyone truly *dislike.*

That being said, avoid the temptation to jump into the deep end and hold off. **I would *NOT* recommend starting with Heroes vs Villains, or with *any* season featuring returning players.** If you do decide to make HvV one of your first seasons to watch, don't get me wrong--you'll probably have a lot of fun, and will likely be able to pick up on a lot of the previously established relationships via context. But you will probably enjoy the experience that much more if you exercise patience and make this season your reward for finishing the first decade (Seasons 1-19). Knowing who the players and having experienced their journeys thusfar will vastly enrich your experience with HvV.

**Disclaimer (just because this was an issue with 5.0): I am not the Survivor police and if you want to watch this season first/without watching the prior seasons, please feel free to do so. There are fans who had this as their very first season who are adamant they would have never been sucked into Survivor without such an explosive season to start them off, and for them, they feel that is more important than having the past history and experience with the cast.

Instead, ask someone to give you just the most basic points that you need to know about the returning players, without too much of the context, just enough for the season's story to make sense.

Basically, it's enough know that 'X is potentially a target because they won their first season', whereas finding out that 'X made the following huge moves and is considered one of the strongest winners' includes details that you don't *have* to know to enjoy the returning player season.

20.0,"Heroes vs.
Villains",dbjuqmd,"Fun season that I rank relatively high. I don't revere it as the awesome godly standout some people do, but I still think it's really fun, so I rank it pretty high.

**BUT!:** The things that I rank it high for are largely **the continuations of previous seasons' storylines.** This season will not be nearly as enjoyable if you haven't seen previous seasons to know who these contestants actually are. The best parts of this season are *specifically* where it follows the journeys of its contestants from their previous appearances.

To fully familiarize yourself with this cast, I think you need to watch seasons 2, 4, 7, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, and 19, at the very least. If you don't, you'll be missing out on a lot of stuff this season AND getting spoiled on those past seasons' outcomes.

And I don't think it's some utterly fantastic orgasmic viewing you should rush into anyway. I think that it's a very fun and satisfying season, but that there *are* more fun and satisfying ones, so you shouldn't, like, neglect all the seasons that don't have HvV people and watch past ones with the sole goal of eventually reaching this or something.

But mostly, returning players out the wazoo, spoilers out the wazoo's wazoo, so don't start here.

I would say the seasons that are *most* spoiled by this one, even above the others, are 7, 10, 16, and 18.

**My Personal Ranking:** 10/32, though 10-12 are all very close.

**Overall verdict:** Solid, entertaining Survivor, but because *all of its cast are returning players* and those previous reputations and relationships do play MAJORLY into the dynamics and stories of this season, you **shouldn't watch it early at all.** You will get less out of it while also getting strongly spoiled on a bunch of previous seasons at once.

All Stars wishes it was like Heroes vs. Villains.

On the 10th anniversary of Survivor, production wanted to end the decade with a bang. They brought back 20 people from previous season who were known for either heroism or villainy (exceptions may apply) and then set them loose. It was one of the best casts ever. It was the culmination of a decade of Survivor stories, feuds, relationships, etc. It was a big-time Clash of the Titans that was hyped up to hell, kind of like All Stars. But unlike All Stars, it did not disappoint.

Unlike All Stars, the strategy is top tier, the boring people do not make it to the end, there are multitudes of huge moves and moments. There are some shockingly stupid moves, too. The premiere is possibly the best ever. The season hits the ground sprinting and never seems to give up. Even in the premerge, there are explosive strategic moments aplenty.

With context, it's even better. Several characters who you may not understand on a first-viewing have their story arcs completed either tragically or incredibly.

I can't stop you from viewing it first or in whatever order you want. But what I can tell you is: it is great without context. It is God-Tier with context, especially from Pearl Islands.

I knew well under half of the contestants (Rupert, Russell, Rob, Colby, kinda Tom, kinda Jerri) and it was still incredible. They did an excellent job with characterization for almost every contestant, and by the end of the season I was crazy for contestants I hadn't even heard of a few months before. 

Recently I have rewatched all of the seasons. HvV, the gold standard of Survivor, was the final season I had watched, and the payoff was incredible.

The season is definitely old school, so if you aren't a huge fan of the old school seasons and their style, then this probably won't be your cup of tea. However, as a piece of Survivor history and the most returnee thick season ever, you need to see it.

As a season, the pre-merge and early merge is great. The characters are all developing and the story is engaging. Then the mid-merge hits and the season begins its descent into mediocrity. The last three or four episodes are sooooooo sloooooooooow and they make the end game really boring to sit through. No joke, the finale is an hour and a half of three people doing nothing for 80% of it. No strategizing, no challenges (and the one they have as the final challenge is lame), and a lot of repetive character scenes we've seen before.

Has some truly legendary and iconic players, moments, and episodes, culminating in an episode that is, for my money, the most intense and dramatic Survivor ever has been and ever will be. The problem is, most of the fun and drama gets sucked out of it later on (with one exception, when nature hits the contestants in a way like we haven’t seen since), and while I do like pretty much everyone in the endgame as individuals, as a whole they aren’t a very interesting group. Definitely a season you have to watch as one of the most important ones of all time — 45 million people watched the first episode as it got to lead out the Super Bowl, and literally half the cast has returned for a future season — but I think it’s one of the few seasons that is significantly more interesting early on than later on, and the lack of forward momentum drags it down a lot.

2.0,"Australian
Outback",dbju74b,"If you liked [the Caleb and Neal evacuations](/spoiler) in Survivor: Kaoh Rong, this might be the season for you.

That said, the thing about Australia is that this is the most ""old-school"" of all old-school seasons - even more, strange as it might sound, than the first one. So if you are looking for constant blindsides and shifting week-to-week twists, you won't find them here. Now, **that isn't a weakness** - but if you're a viewer who wants to know **""What season is just like Cambodia?"", the answer is pretty much ""Not Australia.""** (Which, again, not a weakness: Even at its worst, I enjoy this season a lot more than most of Cambodia. To me, ""Nothing like Cambodia"" is very high praise.) Additionally, if you have watched mostly recent seasons but want to watch some old-school ones, I would not recommend this one *first*, despite the large number of eventual returning players, because if it *is* the first/only one you've seen from that era, it'll misrepresent the era as ""slower"" than it actually is. No other old-school season is quite like Australia.

But, again, this isn't to say it's boring or bad or anything like that. It isn't at all. Australia is a very great television product - not just hugely important to the history of the show, but also a strong enough collection of episodes and characters in their own right that there is a *reason* it is so important other than arbitrarily being the second one. Survivor 2 had to be really, *really* good television to prove that the original wasn't just a gimmicky fluke, and it definitely lived up to what the franchise needed. Being as old-school as old-school gets isn't in any way a weakness: The **nature and survivalism** are stronger here than pretty much anywhere else, giving us some incredibly dramatic and compelling scenes that really drive home **how much more goes on besides just ""the game.""** This season might not be the most popular among some fans who really love the fast pace of the recent seasons; there's definitely strategy stuff going on, but a lot of it is hidden or more subtle. **It isn't a fast-paced, adrenaline one.. but if you're looking for an emotional, character-driven season or a season with focus on nature, Australia is very hard to beat.** Some people might say that the season gets uninteresting after a certain point in the post-merge, but as one poster once wrote on here, ""the endgame villains are the powers of Nature, Ethics and Fate. The Survivors aren't contending with a villainous player, but they're fighting the wilderness, they're fighting their own ethical dilemmas, and they're fighting the unknown.""

It also has a strong enough cast that they *deserve* to be the stuff of legend: The winner is a major, maaaajor favorite of mine whom I'll rant about at length to anyone who will listen and most who won't, and even aside from the winner, the cast features some of the best, most complex, most memorable and beloved characters ever - although I will say that compared to Borneo, Africa, and probably Marquesas, this season *does* have a few more forgettable contestants. But the stars of the season who outshine them are worth it. And on top of all of that, this season contains what I think is **hands down, without question, the best episode in the entire history of Survivor;** even if it weren't already great, this whole season would be worth sitting through just for that one alone. 

Very much worth watching. But I will also add that the entire season is absolutely a reaction to Borneo and how Borneo was perceived at the time: chronological context is more important here than any other season, especially non-returning player ones. Additionally, there's a lot of stuff even outside of historical context that isn't in the episodes but is fairly significant to fully appreciating the season. So I feel **Australia is a season that really benefits from external discussion in addition to just viewing**, and you definitely shouldn't watch it before you watch the first season in whose footsteps it was following (or, more accurately, from whose footsteps it was trying to stray.)

**My Personal Ranking:** 9/32

**Overall verdict:** Not something that you should watch if you want anything like newer Survivor, and neither should it be your introduction to old-school Survivor, both because it's *so* ""old-school-ish"" that it kind of misrepresents the era *and* because it relies heavily on context. But if you are interested in something different from Cagayan or Cambodia and have already seen the first season, its follow-up is a damn fine season containing some legendary contestants and my pick for the best episode ever, as well as a very interesting season to discuss, so it's definitely something any serious Survivor fan should check out *fairly* early.",3

Your enjoyment of Australian Outback depends almost entirely on whether you enjoy this sort of thing. It's a slow-paced, character drama first, and a game second. This season definitely has not aged well, certainly not as well as Borneo has, at least in my opinion.

The biggest thing to understand about this season is the context of the circumstances for these players. Unlike today, where two seasons are filmed back to back and both seasons air months later, Australian Outback was filmed after the first season had already aired. Much of the characters and gameplay are direct responses to how people felt and what they liked about Borneo. This is a lot of why this season hasn't aged very well. Borneo basically created the game, and while Australian Outback did echo some of the gameplay, it was lost in favor of character building and world building. If you were someone watching this season in 2001, then this wouldn't really mean much, because it does feel a lot like Borneo. By today's standards though, it can feel like a slog to get through.

The pre-merge is one of the best ever, ending in an iconic moment, there's heroes and villains, although those terms meant different things at the time. The merge, especially the further you get slows down, and is honestly, quite mediocre. Australia definitely focuses on Survival quite a lot. 

**Rank- 17/33**. Its good, and iconic, but its pretty slow, and starts with a bang, but doesn't have the finish. I really believe Borneo needs to be seen to understand what happened in the Outback, so not a recommendation for first. ",1

For someone who started watching survivor in the new generation and has only ever seen crazy flip flops and excessive idol plays, this season might get a bit boring for you because it focuses primarily on social strategy, and camp life, but if you really want to get an appreciation for an all around great old school survivor season, Australian Outback is a must see. Also if this is your first season ever, there is really only one moment that is confusing but the rest of the season has really understandable gameplay and the editing is great so you will understand everything that happens and really get a feel for what a great survivor season is.

Do not go into Australia expecting it to be an openly cutthroat competition like the kind you'd expect to find in later seasons; if you're coming into it fresh out of Kaôh Rōng, for example, you'll find Australia to be *very* jarring.

31.0,Cambodia,dbjl5zn,"PLEASE. Do not start with this season. Do not watch this season early on in your Survivor watching career. Don’t watch it until you’ve seen every season that the returnees come from. 

Cambodia is a recent season that skews EXTREMELY heavily to one side of the ever discussed strategy/character spectrum. As a full returnee season in an era of Big Moves™, with a Second Chance theme specifically designed for redemption, just about everyone on this season plays the game with a high level of strategic thinking. In my opinion, the best way to watch the show is in order starting with Borneo. This allows you to see and truly appreciate the evolution of the game and how it is played, as well as how the editing has changed throughout all these years. Cambodia is about as modern as it gets in terms of gameplay, and it most likely will sour your enjoyment of earlier seasons that have a lot less focus on strategy if you watch it before them. I’m not saying that you’re not allowed to like Cambodia, but please watch all the other seasons before it. 

In terms of content such as boot order and editing, in my opinion there’s not much to get giddy about here. Fan favourite droning strategists from modern seasons act as airtime sponges while those that don’t ~play the game~ are punished with near invisibility. If you’ve found that you enjoy the more character-oriented side of things, then I doubt you’ll enjoy this season because the more entertaining, not necessarily strategic castaways leave early or receive pitiful amounts of airtime. Because so much of the airtime is devoted to talking about voting and making a move and idols, and because it is a full returnee season, the storylines of each castaway are dependent on their first season. This allows the season to avoid a lot of personal content and relationship building because it assumes you already know and care about all these people. Relationships between people will fade in and out, someone will have a confessional that’s like “oh yeah myself and this person have been bffs since day one” and a lot of the time that’s a complete shock because we haven’t had the chance to see any of that. 

I’m biased because I like a lot of the old school seasons and prefer characters over strategy, but I really don't like Cambodia. I hate what it seems to be doing to the franchise by having these strategy and big move-touting castaways succeed and receive the most airtime. Already, only one season in a post-Cambodia world and we see its effects lingering. I’m definitely not a fan, you might be, but that’s my opinion. ",39
31.0,Cambodia,dbjopke,"**Do not watch this season first.** So much of its appeal is based on knowing the returning players and their stories in advance. The returnees come from seasons 1, 2, 7, 12, 15, 18, 19, 25, 27, 28, 29, and 30, and I’d strongly recommend watching them before jumping into this one.

This season relies on you knowing previous players and their storylines, because you’re not going to learn much about them here. The most strategy-heavy season of all time, with constant talks of evolution of the game and of strategy without us really seeing anything all that new. It's essentially real-life equivalent of an ORG (online reality game); not much humanizing of the biggest characters (with a couple of exceptions), storylines that pick up and drop off out of nowhere, and players not even seeming to care if their own position is in danger in favor of jerking each other off over each other’s gameplay. People say it’s very unpredictable, but I don’t really agree with that either, especially in regards to the winner. If you’re watching for pure entertainment and don’t care all that much about a flowing story or consistent characters, it’s a decent choice I suppose, but I’m personally not a fan after the first few episodes. Whatever you do, just don’t make it your first season under any circumstances.

I kinda liked this season when I first watched it, so I guess you can get enjoyment out of it, but only if you like Survivor mainly for the strategy.  If you like watching the characters at all, you probably won't like this one.  This is the season that is the most strategy-driven, and this comes at the expense of the characters.  There are a couple of good character moments, but they are few and far between.

Also, it spoils tons of great seasons, including Pearl Islands, which is best watched unspoiled.

Don't watch this one first.",26
31.0,Cambodia,dbjyrvb,"I’ll cut to the chase here: Cambodia represents a lot of what I can’t stand about modern Survivor.  It has really inconsistent editing, an extreme over-reliance on strategy and some really weird twists.  I don’t like it.

Even though I can’t stand those things I probably wouldn’t dislike this season as much as I do if there weren’t two additional problems.

The first is that the cast is so focused on strategy that at some point they delude themselves into thinking that they have totally changed the game and taken strategy to the next level.  This makes a few episodes a circlejerk about how they are advancing the game to the next level and how smart they are.  I hate this attitude.  They didn’t advance the game, they simply used strategy that has been in place since Season 6 and gave it a new name.  

The second problem I have is that the cast feels kind of fake this season.  The cast for this season was chosen off of a fan vote, and in order to get votes, some people played it up to the cameras to make themselves seem like bigger personalities and more entertaining than they actually were.  This attitude continued onto the season, leading to quite a few characters being total try-hards the entire time.  One character in particular is guilty of this, and they are among my least favorites ever for doing this, partly because it worked and they got an extremely generous edit for it (it’s likely that those who have seen the season know who I’m talking about, but if you don’t you can PM me and I’ll gladly go on a rant against this person).

That being said it does have some things I like.  Two characters are super entertaining consistently and I do think that they alone make the season somewhat worth a watch.  In addition, Episode 2 is actually insanely good from a character perspective, showing a couple of relationships in an extremely three-dimensional way that feels out of place on the season, and the first four episodes in general are totally solid.  I’m also a fan of the winner for what it’s worth.

I don't hate Cambodia. There are some really good things in there, from a few characters, but for the most part, it just feels like there's no depth, its the farthest Survivor has ever been from its roots, very gameplay and strategy centred, and comes at the expense of character development, and if I don't care about who the strategizers are, or their targets, what's the point? The relationships appear and disappear out of thin air. 

Cambodia is just a mess, too many people were non-entertaining robots, and there's so much focus on strategy that you know what's going to happen, so the positives of unpredictability aren't really here. And the stories are told horribly, as they come and go as the strategic narrative goes, and the people just see everyone else as votes, not people, so the game jumps around, and so does the narrative.

If you watch the show for the strategy and hate when the show throws a joke or emotional arc your way, you'll probably cream your pants over this season as much as the producers did. If you want one of those other things, lol, you're out of luck. This season is 95% strategy, and trust me, it's a mess. The editors rushed to make sense of everything going on and the season doesn't even make sense half the time. People do things for the sake of doing them, whatever stories they threw together are either left unresolved or end with disappointment, and half the cast is wasted to hype up a handful of bland, annoying, and one note characters that never develop by the end of the season. 

The season is also full of forced circlejerking and self congratulation over absolutely a ""new but not new"" strategy and the entire season reeks of this arrogance from episode three onward.

There are also a lot of random twists thrown in that don't help its case, and a couple in particular that pretty much set the season on its eventual path to failure.

Overall, if you love watching people drone on about big moves and strategy in a really arrogant way, watch this. If not, steer clear.

31.0,Cambodia,dbkjhfk,"Okay, I am going to try and defend Cambodia here.

But first, **do NOT start watching Survivor with a returner/all stars season**

This season is by far one of the most strategical seasons by far, and if you are like me and love the strategy aspect with all your heart, this is the season for you. It has 20 returning players, and there are a few that you will be like ""wtf how could they ever return???"" but all of these players fit the theme. I would recommend watching all the season in chronological order so by the time you get to Cambodia you know who is who. 

Cambodia is all about redemption, and all the players come in with strategy guns a blazing. If you are more of a character arc person, this might not be a good season for you, but you should probably still watch it because who knows what will happen in the future.

Back to trying to defend! Cambodia by far is the hardest season strategically and also one of the hardest environmentally. A lot of players get a ton of screen time while others don't, but we get to learn a lot about what is actually going on strategically wise. A lot of people will say that one of the reasons this season isn't great is because of lack of character arcs, but there is so much going on at once that it is hard to put it all in 45 minutes which I understand, but that isn't an excuse.

Major letdown for me after all the pre-season hype.

This season is firmly in the era of #BIGMOVEZ and #STRADERGEE and as such, character moments and many players suffered heavily in the editing process.

Cambodia is a full-returnee season, themed as *Second Chance*, meaning that everyone was a second-time player. It was full of players who came to play and win. As such, it has explosive gameplay aplenty but if you want funny moments, this is not the season for you.

But I don't want to mislead anyone- even if you are a super fan and get strategy and all that, it's not like this is the best season ever anyway. Very little character development, which is VERY weird because A) this cast is pretty good B) The whole theme here is Second Chances, which would make you kinda think ""ok, so we're sorta continuing their legacies from their previous seasons so they can get redemption, well they'll probably explore their characters a lot and we'll see how they've changed and grown!"".

I’ll be the first to admit that this season was not edited very well. Lots of invisible characters and confusing game moves. But, it was just so fun to watch that I can kinda overlook that. Lots of people tried to change their game on their second chance, so seeing version 2.0 of these people was actually really cool. Pre-merge was really good, with a great narrator.

This season is perhaps *the* biggest argument in favor of chronological viewing; the sort of inter-season story of 1 through 4, with a payoff this season, is enhanced *so* much with the context of the previous seasons. Seasons 1-4 are where the chronology is most critical (and then 6/7 are a great follow-up to 4, with 5 - though underrated in my opinion - more skippable if you're not going to watch the whole show.) Marquesas is *revolutionary,* it is *the* most important season to the development of the game after Borneo, and it is the season everybody wanted to exist since episode seven of Borneo.

All chronology aside though? Fuck, this is still fantastic television. It is the apex of post-Borneo Survivor storytelling. Its narrative is probably the most complex, complete, and fulfilling of any season's ever, other than maybe the first one. It's so well-told, so rich and deep, and virtually every contestant, by the time they're out, really does have their path explored in an interesting way, and that path ties necessarily into the paths of all the *other* contestants; it's a brilliant network of complex, interweaving narratives. And that isn't to say that every single contestant gets a major or visible edit, but almost all of them do, and even the ones who don't do have storylines of their own.

And those storylines are all pretty fucking excellent, and they culminate in major climaxes - climaxes that are all the more rewarding for how well they were set up. **It doesn't just rely on Big Moments; it sets the stage very well *for* those moments,** it lets you get to know the people involved, their personalities, their positions, their motivations... so the result is that when big things happen, they're really, *really* big and satisfying.

It's amazing: you have so many moments here that are unlike anything that came before and that then set the stage for future seasons, yet they're still perfectly set up within *this* narrative to be wonderful television even in a vacuum. **It is a critical turning point due to some amazing climaxes, and the stories that lead to those climaxes are told so well.**

It also has what I consider the **best and craziest endgame** in Survivor history. The last two episodes are just nuuuuuts, they're deep and exciting and shocking all at once, with what might be my all-time favorite Survivor finale capping it off. So much freaking stuff happens in that endgame and there are so many twists. And with the ultimate outcome being what it is, I think Marq improves even more on a rewatch.

And even aside from all of this big stuff, the cast is pretty freaking entertaining. Even when it isn't being epic and groundbreaking, the season is still fun as hell. Lots of quirky and colorful personalities doing dynamic and memorable things. 

A hell of a story and definitely, 50000% worth watching.

**My Personal Ranking:** 3/32 though it's reaaally splitting hairs between the top three.

If you had, in 2001 after ""Survivor: Africa"", told someone how Marquesas would go - let alone how expertly they'd put together the events into a television story - they'd have said.. what? no, fuck you, that's not possible, stop getting my hopes up.

In particular, it has a character that pretty much codified the growth edit and the character who I believe was the first real Survivor villain.

There's a moment where, if you are watching the seasons in order, really marks a turning point in Survivor strategy, so if you are looking for that, this season is one to watch closely.

You do really get attached to the characters, among them some comedians, some good guys, some good villains, and some of the most raw and emotional moments of all time.

4.0,Marquesas,dbjnzon,"Marquesas is the season where the strategic game has a much larger focus compared to the first 3 seasons.   You can see the origins of today's strategic game play without losing the old school flavours of survivor character stories and camp life.

It features probably the weakest challenge and set design of the older seasons, the edit is dominated by one particularly bloated edit that smothers out everyone else (which makes it hard if you dislike that character; I do, indeed, dislike them), and the strategy fails to be as interesting as its predecessor, *Africa*.

It has given two returnees, one of whom has become the faces of the franchise, so it's at least worth watching to see them develop. It's an underwhelming season in practice, though, and it's not one I recommend.",3

Some fun characters though, both pre and post-merge, including a character that would go on to be one of the most well-known Survivors ever (So if you want to see his/her origin story, Marquesas is worth a watch) and an ‘archetype’ that will be featured in many, many seasons to come (done very well here). 

A very important season in the evolution of the game. For newbies, certainly watch this one after seasons 1-3.  Not my top choice for someone who wants to go back and watch a season, but it’s pretty good overall.

It is the quintessential moment that the game truly changed. In seasons 1, 2, and 3, there were brief moments of strategy, but in season 4, the script flipped, and things suddenly became very strategic in a hurry.

It is the moment that the game stopped being about just survival, and eyes were opened to just how far Survivor could go. No longer could you get far, just on loyalty and hard-work alone. You had to work hard, and be loyal, without being seen to be working too hard, or be too loyal. If you were good at challenges? You had a more than decent chance of going home. If you weren't willing to be flexible? You were expendable. Options became real in a way they had never existed.

The reason that many people dislike it does not ruin the season in my opinion. The F4 tribal council is also iconic.",18
13.0,Cook Islands,dbjnqq6,"Cook Islands is a great season for people just getting into the show in that it has a great story that is easy to follow and is lead by some very strong characters. You will see this season slagged on a *lot*, but keep in mind that a lot of the people who aren't fond of it dislike it because it doesn't hold up well *on rewatch.* If you're going into it not knowing what will happen, you're probably going to have a lot of fun with the ride ahead of you. 

That being said, there are some negatives that will show even to newer and first-time viewers. Firstly, Cook Islands is one of Survivor's more notorious seasons in that they divide the castaways into four tribes based on racial identity, a twist which is questionable to say the least. The biggest weakness of Cook Islands, however, is that it features a large cast (20 people) with a lot of contestants who are either under-edited or just fail to make an impact. However, many of it's leading characters are contestants who now have huge fanbases--four contestants from Cook Islands will each go on to make two more appearances *each* on future seasons, and one of them is gearing up for Game #4 on Survivor 34. 

Cook Islands is nowhere near one of my personal favorites, but I'm upvoting it because I think it's a good season for new fans to watch earlier in their viewing as opposed to later (unless of course you're watching in order). ",11
13.0,Cook Islands,dbjz6j2,"I love this season. It was one of the first seasons I ever watched when going back to watch old seasons and I was shocked that people didn't like it.

This season is also a must watch because it introduces future Survivor legends who appear in popular returnees seasons to come: Parvati, Ozzy, & Penner.",4
13.0,Cook Islands,dbjumbq,"Cook Islands is often a kind of polarizing season. Personally, I really, really, *really* dislike it - and I did the first time I watched it, too, so I don't even think it's a case of a season that only disappoints on a rewatch. I think it's incredibly dull, I think its only ostensibly and potentially notable storylines are the direct result of lame twists and have their effects diminished by the minor edits or dull personalities of the contestants they involved, I think it's *easily* the worst cast in Survivor history (maybe bested by S26) despite a few stars.. **When people just say ""CI is boring"", I think that's giving it too much credit,** because it's *also* a convoluted mess of horrible editing, boring contestants, and pointless twists.

But, that said, a lot of people do really enjoy it, so it can't hurt to check it out at some point, because maybe you'll be one of them.

In any case, though, **I definitely wouldn't recommend this one as an early season.** Even if you like some of its storylines, its *massive* amount of underedited contestants and bafflingly large array of twists leave this a very ""un-Survivor-y"" season that I don't think accurately represents what's often great about the franchise. And there are other seasons that have a lot of its potential strengths (and more strengths) with few to none of its massive, glaring flaws... Even if you don't end up disliking Cook Islands, there are still a lot of other seasons you're almost sure to get much more out of than this one, and it's regardless a pretty unrepresentative one that probably shouldn't be put near the beginning. I think the only reason to put this one anywhere even remotely early in your Survivor viewing is because a few of its contestants came back later on... but honestly, even then, two of them barely matter in this season and were kind of headscratcher picks that shined more on later seasons, and I think the other two have stories that are pretty much divided by season and don't require Cook Islands to be viewed before the others.

So yeah, there is little to no reason to prioritize this, but maybe you might like it.

**My Personal Ranking:** 29/32

**Overall verdict:** I think it's super dull and much of the time actively awful with its twists and editing. It does have some fans, though, so you might enjoy it - but even though it has some players whom production liked enough to bring back later on, I don't think it should be one of the first few seasons you watch by any means. It doesn't represent the show well, and there are other seasons that have a lot of its potential strengths and more with few to none of its massive, glaring flaws.

There are an absolute shitton of weird twists (especially the opening tribe divisions). You will remember or like maybe 5 people from this season unless you've watched some returnee seasons before it, and that's a full 25% of the cast.

Keep in mind, new viewer, that many of the problems that people have with this season are peoples opinions on a rewatch of the season, not the first time playing. It was one of my first seasons, and it was an amazing starting point to learn about the game. Cook Islands was at a point in the series where the focus was less on pure survival and more when I feel that the game truly revolved around strategy, and this season features one of my all time favorite story-lines in all of Survivor.

It also has a lot of characters who make multiple return appearances, making this a good introduction to them and their stories.

The focus of this season is on the action, so the characters sometimes fall by the wayside; out of the 20 in the season, you might struggle to remember half of them. The ""racial divide"" twist is also a bit awkward; it never really ruins the season, but it's ham-fisted and results in some bland contestants as they try to avoid playing up negative stereotypes.

I can't think of any season that has more characters who are just plain forgettable -- and some of these forgettable characters are so forgettable despite lasting all the way to the end of the game. There’s also so many twists that it’s hard to really classify it as a pure, fair game. It does introduce some players who would go onto be important later on, the location is absolutely stunning, there are some pretty cool challenges and theming (it has my favorite Tribal Council set ever), and as I said it does have quite a bit of fans, so I guess I’d say it’s worth checking out at some point.

21.0,Nicaragua,dbjkveb,"Okay, so Nicaragua is one of the most polarizing seasons **ever**. Theres a lot of good in the season, mixed with a lot of bad, and that causes love and hate for Nicaragua across the Survivor fanbase. Ive barely ever seen anyone on Reddit that doesnt either:

1 Absolutely love Nicaragua

Or 

2 Despise everything about Nicaragua



 Im happy to say I love Nicaragua. It has some of the wackiest, most abnormal characters in Survivor history. But for this post, I want to talk about one character in particular, because this one person will almost definitely be a huge factor in why you either love or hate Nicaragua.

 This person causes unreasonable drama, makes unexplainable moves, and gets some of the most hilarious, outraged reactions out of who is probably one of the most chill people to ever play this game. I mean, its to the point where this person makes Jeff **speechless**. Yes, the Jeff Probst, whos been hosting Survivor for 10 years at the time, has absolutely no words for the complete and utter insanity that is this player.

This player would probably be in the Survivor HOF somewhere if not for one decision they made. This one decision massively altered the game, and probably lost this player a lot of support from fans.

  Now, for those whove seen Nicaragua and know exactly who Im talking about, youre probably either appreciating the fact that this player is getting some love, or youre wondering how in the hell I could say one good thing about this player. Well guess what, its my opinion, and Im holding on to it til the day I die (is this too dramatic? Probably, but who cares.) Im most definently in the minority when I say that I feel this character is amazing, there are a lot of people who consider this player a season ruining asshole that spreaded negativity, and even though I respect their opinions, I think they are 100% wrong /s. 

If you're new to Survivor, and you're trying to decide which season to watch first, I wouldnt choose this one. Its a little bit too wacky, and wont give you a rounded idea of what Survivors about like other seasons will. However, if you want to watch a season full of clueless people and what the fuckery, Nicaraguas the place to go.

I believe Nicaragua is a great, unconventional season with great characters and a great winner. Its not everyones cup of tea, I get that, but for me, its just right. Definitely my #1.

21.0,Nicaragua,dbk1wm0,"This is my favourite season of all time. It's definitely a highly polarizing season for the fanbase; the people that love Nicaragua *really* love Nicaragua, and the people that hate Nicaragua *really* hate Nicaragua. I'm going to list off a few of the reasons why you should put Nicaragua in your love shack and give it a wild ride.

* Golden characters. Casting went to diverse and unique circles all across America, asked ""Who is the single most unaware person in this circle?"" and put them on the coast of Nicaragua for 39 days. Everyone is oblivious, which makes for fascinating Survivor; what do you get when every single person feels like they're running the show? Entertainment, that's what. People dominating Survivor is nice, but cocky and oblivious people constantly fucking up is even nicer. 

* Consistent entertainment. Because the game is being run by these egos, they often run against each other in fantastic ways. There are fights galore where all you want to do is grab more popcorn. There's hilariously nonsensical gameplay. There's plenty of bitterness. This leads to two of the most entertaining tribes in Survivor history, and among the best one liners.

* The darkness. Not everyone is here for sunshine and rainbows. The main season villain is one of my favourite of all time because of *how* ridiculously over the top they are with their hate. There's a controversial point later in the season that highlights the impact the game of Survivor has on people.

* The spice. It seems like everything done in Nicaragua is done with the express purpose of causing as much fallout as possible. Think Gabon but with a dash of cayenne. This is a VERY character driven season, and the characters just pop off the screen. No weak spots.

I highly recommend Nicaragua.",8
21.0,Nicaragua,dbjt357,"Nicaragua is fairly polarizing.  Some people (myself included), love the season for its insane cast, abundance of fun moments, general craziness and surprising depth in the mid-merge.  I personally think it’s the funniest season of all time.  The season is so funny that even Jeff Probst becomes hilarious at many times throughout the season.  
The winner is one of my all-time favorites because of how hilarious they are.  Sometimes when I talk about the winner of this season I forget they won because they are just that good on screen.  They get a lot of crap strategically but I think they played a pretty good game as well, I’ll argue that till the day I die.  

Most write-ups about Nicaragua focus on its craziness, but it gets really serious at times.  One episode in the mid-merge (probably the most polarizing episode of all time) is really deep and one character throughout the season provides a grounding force to the season’s more crazy personalities (though they can be crazy as well).

One character in particularly stands out as particularly bad, some people find her funny I don't. She unnecessarily dominates the screen for whatever reason and is just an incredibly unpleasant character to deal with. She for me probably goes down as my least favorite contestant on Survivor and probably the worst casting decision the show has ever made. 

There are some fun contestants like an underestimated 'airhead' model named Fabio, and a frantic strategist claiming to be a chess grandmaster but otherwise there's not much to see.

Don't watch it folks.",6
21.0,Nicaragua,dbjuh1r,"**Positives**

* Really insane cast, but in a good way.Mostly.

* The post merge, which is when most of the character narratives  kicks off, is really good.

* Really satisfying finish.

* There's one episode which was easily the most controversial episode of the season, but I loved it and now rank it in my top 10 Modern Survivor episodes.

**Negatives**

* Bad theme. Young vs old wasn't as bad as Millennials vs Gen X but its still something we've seen in almost every season so making that into a theme was really unnecessary. 

* The pre-merge has a weird fever dream-ish vibe to it that I really didn't enjoy.

* The big villain of the season, while being entertaining 60% of the time is also cringeworthy for the rest and I'd say that your enjoyment of the season hinges on your enjoyment of this character.

I find it to be a bit poorly executed in that there were some editing flaws (to the point it has become a joke among the fanbase) and some unlikable players/uncomfortable moments. It's definitely worth it, though.

There are some ridiculous players, some ridiculous plays, and some ridiculous commentary from Jeff, so it checks all the boxes required to be a good season on paper.

Personally, I don't dislike the season, but I don't like it all that much either. It ranks in my bottom 10 (27th), but that's not because of any single factor for me, it's the whole of the season, and the fact I believe there to be 26 better seasons, which is just a testament to how good the series is.

Funny, both my girlfriend and I had watched season 1 when it aired and then forgot about the show. A few years ago we were scrolling through the small amount of content available on Amazon Prime Video and saw Survivor on there and that there were over 20 seasons. We had no idea it was still on. We chose at random and landed on Nicaragua as our first return to Survivor. We hadn't followed the show at all, and didn't know about hidden immunity idols, and certainly the medallion of power really confused us.

Still, when it was over we were hooked and really upset when it dawned on us afterward that when we moved on to the next season, there would be no one from this ""amazing cast."" We know now that it's not a perfect season, but it holds a very special place in our hearts and wasn't a bad one to ""start"" with. And for what it's worth, u/thezenithpoint, I totally agree with you on the polarizing character. Great TV, and someone I'd like to see return but who I don't think will unfortunately.

While the season definitely does have some flaws, I think many of those flaws are what makes this season much better than you would think. There is one twist from the beginning of the game that many people despise, though I do defend it for a few reasons (can't say on here because it spoils things but feel free to send a message). There are some characters that receive quite a bit of hate from the fanbase, but once again, there are defenses to be made for those characters, and the value they bring to both the season and the franchise as a whole. On top of that, there are some things about the season that do actually have a mass level of appeal, specifically one character who was HUGE at the time, and another who I would argue is the greatest player of all time.

So while this isn't the most beloved season, there are a lot of things to enjoy about it if you try and go in with a clean slate. If you've seen a few seasons and enjoy the strategical aspect of the show, this season should be for you. If you enjoy the characters, this season should be for you.",8

These characters are rootable, fun, and they end up succeeding over the villains of the season - which is obviously a great thing.

It has an insanely good boot order, with the three best characters of the season making it all the way to the finale, and all three of them have strong, complex relationships that are among Survivor’s very best.  

This season is definitely not lacking from a strategic standpoint.  It features a ton of innovative moves, some of which have become staples.  There are two moves in particular that I think are incredible, one of which sets off one of the greatest character arcs in the history of the show.

14.0,Fiji,dbjump1,"Fiji is a polarizing season. Lots of people hate it, some vocal people love it, I'd say its overall reception is neutral bordering on negative. Personally, ""neutral bordering on negative"" is exactly how I feel about it, too. Whenever you do watch it, you'll take some good stuff out of it: the winner is fantastic, one or two of the characters are probably among Survivor's best, and there are some super fun and complex moments along the way.

But... those moments and characters are few and far between. A lot of the episodes are just ""blah"" and uninspiring, and massive amounts of the cast are underedited nothings whom you'll have no reason to care about; among those who aren't, most are unlikable ones you probably won't enjoy, leaving this season a relatively ugly one. And there are some *really* bad twists here, too. I don't dislike it - I'm ambivalent towards it - but I rank it lowest out of all the seasons I don't dislike, and it definitely has some really strong flaws. Despite the occasional gem, the overall feeling of this season - with its boring episodes, forgettable contestants, and weird twists - is basically Cook Islands 2.0 (though it is much better than Cook Islands.)

And those flaws are also things that make it, just... *weird.* It's a *weird* season. It has weird twists, it has weird editing, it has a weird assortment of contestants, so it's certainly not something you should start with, because it is really not a good representation of, like, *anything* about the show. Cook Islands and Fiji were a weird pair of seasons where I'm not exactly sure what the producers were going for (and I don't know if they were too sure, either.)

Location is freaking stunning, though.

**My Personal Ranking:** 24/32

**Overall verdict:** It has some diehard fans and it has some great moments/characters, so it is worth watching, but I don't think there's any real reason to watch it early, especially because, if nothing else, it's just a weird season. You may very well end up being one of those who enjoy it once you do watch it, but I can't think of why it'd be prioritized, and it would be a pretty strange and off-putting introduction to the series.",3
14.0,Fiji,dbkkamj,"This season once was universally panned as the worst season ever. It had a twist that made it seem like an artificial Palau. The winner was super obvious (though played the best game ever imo). The cast was 85-90% bad, 10-15% amazing. The premerge was extremely long and boring.

However, this season is definitely a diamond in the rough because of what it does right. It is without a doubt the most strategically groundbreaking season outside of the first few.

There is a lot to dislike in Fiji. There are multiple twists that are just straight up garbage. As in the producer who came up with them should be fired bad. There is also a 19 person cast that suffers from a huge number of players who are either under-edited/irrelevant and/or kind of deplorable. There is, quite frankly, plenty *not* to like in Fiji.

But if you muck through the shit, there are a lot of hidden gems. There are some genuinely hysterical moments, bursts of exceptional gameplay, and some really wonderful contestants. They maybe aren't enough to drag the season totally out of the mud, but they do their damn best.

It is filled with unlikable characters, unexplained vote-offs, and absolutely terrible tribe division twist. There is really nothing interesting going on in these episodes at all.

I also think that the post-merge only seems great because of how much better it is than the miserable pre-merge. There are some great moments, but there are only 1, maybe 2 episodes that I would are great. The rest are just decent enough to save the season from being a total waste.

However, as a season, your enjoyment of it will stem from how much you like about, I don't know, two or three main characters. The editing bloats them up so much that most of the cast is wasted into obscurity and it has no shame about that.

19.0,Samoa,dbjync6,"Don't start with this. Don't watch it second. Or third. Only watch it when you understand exactly the point of this season, because context matters more for this season than any other.

For starters, and this is the biggest problem, the editing is atrocious. Some characters are outright ignored in favor of two people, one of which is the most polarizing figure in the entire franchise. Context is the biggest gateway to watching this season, and a big part of the issue is understanding why the season was edited the way it was, because it was very intentional. Definitely an important season, but just falls into the land of mediocrity in what could have been something great.

The casting is something that should have been awesome. There are some great characters, but unfortunately we don't get to see a lot of them. The cast is not outright bad, but we just don't get to know most of these people.

Lastly, and this is big, if you're watching this season, you need to understand why it ends the way it does. There was a lot of controversy surrounding Samoa, and understanding the context of everything that happened is huge. I'll suggest watching the fan edited version, I think it could make the experience much more watchable.

This is hard to judge because while it's overall an incredibly mediocre season, it's not skippable at all. In fact it's one of the least skippable seasons in the show. So if you do decide to watch it, keep an open mind about what's actually happening.",3
19.0,Samoa,dbjxxu0,"Oh, god, *Samoa*. It's a hard season to really discuss, because a lot of it revolves around the bloated edit of one individual and how they're the axis around which everything in *Samoa* rotates. They played in the following season, *Heroes vs. Villains*, so it makes sense that they'd get an inflated edit, but this goes beyond what almost any contestant has ever gotten and will get again.

That said, *Samoa* is a bit of a diamond in the rough. There's an interesting cultural undercurrent at times in the season, and how it influences the early game is interesting to watch. The conditions are brutal, the characters when you get to see them are fascinating, and the story (especially after the merge) is an improved version of the *Cook Islands* story. It's also important strategically, as several elements of gameplay present in past seasons are deployed in new and different ways that would influence the show for years to come.

There are some positives to it; one tribe in particular is very fun to watch, and as I said, the cast as a whole is likable enough. I wouldn’t call it “boring” like many of the other seasons that I rank low on my list. If you want to fully understand Survivor, how it works, and discuss it on the internet, it’s an absolute must-watch at some point. But just make sure that when you’re watching it you keep an open mind about what is actually going on the entire time, remembering that the editors pack hundreds of hours of footage into 14 43-minute episodes.

There are plenty of legitimate knocks against this season; it mostly revolves around the same four players, all of whom are very polarizing; there is a lot of tediousness and contrived suspense; and lots of characters are essentially ignored. But it also features some of the darkest and most sociologically intriguing stuff the show has ever seen, especially towards the end. It doesn’t hurt that I am an absolutely humungous fan of this season’s winner and literally everything they say and do. Lots of people find the dark stuff more uncomfortable than intriguing, and I can’t say blame them, and while the winner is mostly very popular, most people don’t tend to think they redeem the season quite as much as I do. In any case though, I’d say it’s head and shoulders above the rest of the unholy trinity of 22-24, and you should definitely try to keep an open mind about watching it.

South Pacific is one of the most unpopular seasons overall, and while I agree with the consensus that there are many unlikeable characters, some of whom make it deep into the game, the pre-merge is full of fun, quirky characters and moments that I love. While the post merge is much darker than usual and has some very controversial themes and moves; I personally loved watching such an odd way of playing the game. It's a bizarre season with unique themes and characters and a damn good winner imo.

Why do I like South Pacific more than its reputation? It starts out incredibly strong. The premerge and merge episode are fantastic. There are some really fun or funny characters who are early boots, in addition to the great ones at the end. The season manages to fast forward through the slow parts to get to the good stuff. And the good stuff is really good. 

South Pacific also handles the subject of religion with such nuance and care. In many early seasons, religion is treated as something that makes people weird. In South Pacific, there is very careful treatment of it, and it plays an important role without being overbearing. 

Is South Pacific an all-time great season? No. Most certainly not. But it's middle of the road, and is dragged down by the reputation of seasons surrounding it temporally. ",2

The editing is lopsided and heavily skewed in favor of four characters, a strong pre-merge leads into a fairly unexciting post-merge, and the infamous Redemption Island twist returns to oddly skew each episode's flow and pacing.

That said, *South Pacific* is actually a decent season, the highlight of the five ""Dark Ages"" seasons for me. The pre-merge is actually very strong, two evenly-matched tribes battling it out for supremacy. The post-merge gets dark at times, with a lot of religious content and interesting questions of morality, though that darkness makes for a bit of uncertainty in the home stretch. It also has one of the strongest finales of recent memory, a finale that might have saved the series from the death spiral it was threatening to go into.

*South Pacific* has two returning players, who each appeared on two previous seasons. You should definitely watch *Cook Islands* and *Tocantins* to know who they are, and both *Micronesia* and *Heroes vs. Villains* help flesh them out and are recommended viewing. *South Pacific* has had four players return for future seasons, with three on *Caramoan* and one on the upcoming *Game Changers*.

Sadly, ""better than Redemption Island in every single possible way"" is not a huge accomplishment. It's still freaking terrible in all respects (sans the winner). This season still features the terrible Redemption Island, still features two returnees who you will probably not like seeing again, a terrible cast, and an unbalanced edit (In RI, they focused mostly on 2 people, in SoPa, they focused mostly on 4 people, so I guess that's an improvement).

One such returning player in this season has a season that might be his best strategically, while being his least entertaining from a story standpoint.

So whether you love SoPa _____ or hate him, is going to depend a lot on what you like about a character. If you love over the top charisma, then SoPa ______ will be your least favorite, far and away. But if you love strategy, and a scaling back to a more ""normal"" version of an interesting person, then you will think SoPa _____ is a fun character.

For me, a lot of SoPa is tied into this specific player, and that might be the same for everyone else. Make seasons 18 and 20 (and all the pre-20 seasons that need to be watched) must-watches before SoPa. You COULD watch this before 18 or 20, and it will be an interesting introduction to the character, giving you a different sense of his character arc.

8.0,All-Stars,dbjl6xd,"All-Stars is not a great season. But I’ll argue that it’s an above-average season if you come at it a certain way.

When I rewatched all seasons for Rankdown I (God, to be in my 20s again), All-Stars surprised me the most for being more enjoyable than expected.

Here’s the thing: All-Stars is not a happy season. Flip the boot order and you get a much cheerier and traditionally enjoyable season. But we can’t do that. So we’re left with what actually happened, and what happened is a Greek tragedy of sorts. Think: *King Lear*, *No Country for Old Men*, *Things Fall Apart*, or *A Storm of Swords*.

Lovable heroes are cut down before their prime by cackling villains who think nothing of it. Friendships developed over the course of years are betrayed overnight. Players who know they’re doomed march towards certain demise anyways. Those who do the make the late game end up tarnished for having done so. Nobody comes out of All-Stars looking better. Everyone suffers. 

When the villains do ultimately triumph, what they get is not the glory they expect, but instead must face atonement in what’s easily Survivor’s most bitter FTC. And then they still get away with it! There’s hardly a moment of comeuppance or remorse in All-Stars. It’s unapologetically cutthroat.

Also worth mentioning is that All-Stars contains the worst moment in the show’s history. Without spoiling the full horror — which includes the cast *laughing* at someone who may have suffered sexual assault — this moment never would have made the final edit in today’s culture. For starters, it would have set off a national outcry like when Snooki got punched in Season 1 of *Jersey Shore*. And secondly, it’s just fucking revolting and should never have been aired in the first place. It’s the nadir of Survivor.

But in the end it sort of fits into the unintended theme of All-Stars. Rather than the typically cheerier Survivor themes of perseverance and social bonds, All-Stars becomes about the mortality of heroes, the cruelty of villains, how the allure of money and power can ruins friendships, and how, like in *Hamlet* or Game of Thrones, nobody wins in all-out war.

There are so many uplifting, funny seasons of Survivor. If you want a change of pace, check out All-Stars. It’s a dark drama, a much different flavor or style of Survivor. It’s the antithesis of a normal Survivor season, and is worth watching for that reason alone.

Edit: Removed an unintended spoiler. My bad!",17
8.0,All-Stars,dbjp9f6,"If I had to rank all the seasons by how good they are for a new viewer to watch, this one would be right at the bottom.

It's ugly, so ugly that it makes Thailand look like the postmerge of Australian Outback.  The absolute worst moment in Survivor history happens here, and it somehow tarnishes the legacy of many of the best old-school players.  The post-merge is a slog to get through, and the ending is pretty unsatisfying.

It also spoils Seasons 1 through 7, which is not good for a first-time viewer.

Please don't watch this one first.  Redemption Island is a better first-time watch then this one.",6
8.0,All-Stars,dbjucvg,"Yikes. I recently rewatched All-Stars for the first time. I didn't remember it in enough detail to have a strong opinion of it (hence the rewatch), but as a big Survivor fan who of course likes to enjoy the show, and as a *particularly* diehard fan of the show's earlier years, I went in with as high of hopes as possible. Now I didn't expect to particularly *like* All-Stars, but I thought I could *maybe* like it, at *least* come out sort of ambivalent or apathetic, and certainly not dislike it as much as most people do. I thought that its balanced edit would at least make it sort of refreshing coming out of Cambodia, a returning player season I didn't enjoy. I thought I'd be able to sort of appreciate this one, albeit mildly.

It exceeded even my wildest expectations.

As much as I hoped to be okay with this season, it was so much fucking worse than I had ever, *ever* imagined it could possibly be.

I know some All-Stars fans like to liken it to some epic, Shakespearean tragedy. I strongly disagree, because Shakespearean tragedies are dynamic and interesting. All-Stars isn't some grand tragedy full of dark but polarizing moments that are epic and sure to bring up strong emotions in you. The problem with All-Stars isn't just that it has dark moments. The problem with All-Stars is that it has some really gross, ugly moments while somehow also being *really fucking boring.*

The image of All-Stars as some epic tragedy seems to come almost entirely from one episode in the middle of the season. That one story, sure, I can buy that it's what S8's fans claim the whole season is. But at least 90% of the time, this season is as boring as it is frustrating - and one particular pre-merge episode is so repulsive it's one of the most popular picks for the worst episode in the history of the show, and that horrendous episode exposes almost every single contestant who sticks around as absolutely horrible, which brings the future episodes from boring to... well, still boring, but now involving unlikable pricks.

Essentially, **the season only emerges from putting me to sleep when it's time to display how horrendously unlikable its cast is to ensure that I still hate them when they're sitting around doing nothing, rendering it less like the Red Wedding and more like a dull headache that won't go away.**

All-Stars isn't *totally* without its strengths: episode three is actually pretty damn great, and *several* other episodes (all in the first half of the season) have *some* fun moments... but when the best defense I can possibly make of this season is ""it isn't pointlessly, irredeemably awful *every* week! Only most of the time!"", that isn't a good sign. That isn't a selling point. It's more like, if you've already decided to sit through this one, well, you will get *some* scraps of good out of it. If you're specifically planning on watching every single season, then there is some good stuff here, but if you aren't... I cannot think of a single reason to watch this before virtually anything else. I mean, one player does become more memorable (and unlikable) here in a way that informs their future casting on the Villains tribe, but considering you can just be told ""That player was a villain in All-Stars"" to more or less the same effect, that's not a strong reason.

Of course, this is still just one person's opinion, and maybe you'll like it if you watch it... but this one person's opinion is that he'd have a really, really hard time ever understanding why and cannot think of any reason why he'd ever recommend this to anyone.

...And as a full returning player season, there's obviously no reason to start here anyway. If you're not a first-time viewer, though - if you're watching a few seasons and wondering whether All-Stars will be interesting as the first returning player show and this alleged spectacle of darkness - my answer is an incredibly solid no.

**My Personal Ranking**: 30/32

**Overall verdict**: I am not exaggerating when I say that I would rather watch paint dry for 15 straight hours than sit through this season again, and, other than watching every season, I cannot think of literally any reason why I would ever recommend this season to absolutely anybody.

The first 5 episodes are fun, but it soon spirals into a mess including some of the nastiest and most unpleasant episodes Survivor has ever produced. Some of the darkness of the whole thing appeals to some people, the novelty of seeing all returnees for the first time is pretty cool at the beginning, and the main storyline of the season also has some appeal. But I really can’t stand the overall vibe of the season; the players are always either angry or miserable, almost nobody is having any fun, and after the season reaches its climax (which itself is surrounded by controversy and nastiness), it’s just really, really boring, with many of the biggest and most larger than life personalities the show has seen being reduced to nothing.

8.0,All-Stars,dbjsprn,"I recognize that All-Stars has some appeal.  On paper it has a super stacked cast full of pretty much everyone you’d want to see from Seasons 1-7.  Sure there are some questionable choices but of my top 18 characters from Seasons 1-7, 14 are on this season, which is a super impressive ratio.  There are some really fun moments that take advantage of the strong cast and Episode 3 in particular is a great episode no matter what season it’s in.  Some people love the central storyline of the season. 
That being said, it’s my least favorite season ever.  
The first problem with the season is that it takes all of these legendary characters and makes them worse.  Some extremely complex characters are made one-note, some very positive characters do a complete 180º turn and some are just shut out.  Of the 18 people on this season, I’d say that only two improve on their original versions, with some going from top-tier characters to bottom-tier characters.

However, the main problem I have with the season is the tone.  Nobody looks like they’re having fun with the exception of two characters, both of whom contribute awful things to the season anyway.  Everyone is really serious in a way that’s not fun to watch, which really hurts the watchability of the season.
I’m also not a fan of the main story lines throughout the season.  I find the main story to be pretty boring and I think its presence makes all the characters involved worse.  
Even with all of the above qualities I would probably put it above Redemption Island, but there’s one episode that pushes it over the top.  This season contains the worst episode in Survivor history.  It’s awful and makes everyone involved in the central event look terrible.  Even fans of the season will admit that this moment is terrible.  It’s irredeemable.
That being said, it is sort of essential viewing.  All Stars changed everything strategically, and its impact is noticeable starting with Vanuatu.  In addition, quite a few characters on All Stars return for Heroes Vs. Villains, and their stories in All Stars play a part in that season.  If you don’t want to watch every season and only want to see how the game progresses, All Stars should be third on your watch list, following Borneo and Marquesas.

Everyone, and I do mean everyone, expected this season to be a big-time Clash of the Titans, thrilling from start to finish, where only the best of the best players would survive.

Instead, most of the Titans were simply cut down before the merge and had their legacies tarnished. The bootlist is probably the worst that Survivor has ever seen.

This is honestly the first, and only time I will ever say this, but it might be worth watching this season BEFORE the seasons listed above, and here's why.

Even if it ends up spoiling the winners of 1, 2, 3, and 6, this story is unique, in that it ruins the legacies of nearly every player to play in it, while creating a monster that went on to play in 4 seasons (4, 8, 20, and 22).

This season was basically a showmance season, and not one indicative of what Survivor is typically about. If you have this as your first season, you are unfortunate in that you will have wildly different expectations about what Survivor is/was about (for me, this was my first FULL season. I started post-merge in Pearl Islands).

There is some seriously cut-throat gameplay that is very interesting to watch, as many players in future seasons list one specific player on their ""Which Survivor are you most like"" lists that gets his true rise to power in this season. And it's his cut-throat gameplay that makes him such an icon.

Without spoiling too much else, it also has an interesting Final Tribal, in that we can truly coin the term ""bitter jury"", for better or worse. The first seven seasons had a handful at best, but with this being the first all-star season, so many had so much to lose, this was back when Survivor was a phenomenon that could build or destroy your life.

With so much at stake, any single slight could be taken as a major act of betrayal, and this season is full of that.

30.0,Worlds Apart,dbjl6lx,"Worlds Apart is an incredibly underrated season. I can't blame the fanbase for not being too fond of it, but it is definitely NOT a bottom five season as a lot of people seem to agree it is. Worlds Apart has a stellar premerge, and has a bright cast of characters with a few duds. However, a few episodes into the merge it gets extremely dark, and dips in quality quite a bit. 

It's a funny season with great (and some atrocious) character moments, with a satisfying winner with a good arc, and I'd consider it a good enough midtier season. It's not top half at all due to its many problems, but its no where near Thailand, RI, SP, OW levels of garbage imo.",23
30.0,Worlds Apart,dbkl9pg,"I like Worlds Apart much, *much* more than most people on this subreddit.

Yes, there is awful, uncomfortable behavior (sexism and bullying, to be exact). There is a bad boot order. The winner's edit is clear from very early on.

However, there are some things that redeem this. [The bad behavior is eventually punished, and the winner becomes a massive hero who destroys the villains. It's kind of like Survivor: The Superhero Movie.](/spoiler) (Not sure if this is spoiler-worthy.)

30.0,Worlds Apart,dbjmh6t,"This is a season that gets better with age. Every few months, I like it more and more. At a first glance, it's a really funny and engaging cartoon of a season with wacky characters and romantic (not lovey dovey romance mind you, just the artistic variety) arcs with good and evil being the two big forces. That being said, there is a pretty ugly moment or two, but it doesn't overshadow the season or anything like a lot of people claim, and it's no worse than what goes down in some old school favorites. It just sticks with you because it's pretty powerful 

Worlds Apart isn't for everyone, but I think it's worth a watch just for the comedy and the winner's story.

There are a few people who actually like the people on this season, so if you find yourself enjoying them after a couple episodes, you might enjoy this season. But if you, like most people, find them to be whiny, irritating, and even downright mean, don’t expect the season to get any better. I personally absolutely hate this cast, particularly [Dan Foley](/spoiler), who I think is the #1 worst Survivor character of all-time.

30.0,Worlds Apart,dbjuua0,"Lame twists. Lame editing and storytelling. *Very* lame boot order. Bookended with a really weak premiere and a really weak finale.

It has *some* great characters, but I think that they all go out way too soon, and there's a lot of ugliness, *especially* among the endgamers. Even besides that, I think the season was just sort of *dull.* There are, like, two episodes that I really enjoyed. Contrast that with SJDS where there are only two episodes I *didn't* really enjoy, and you have something there is no reason to start with and really no reason to watch if you aren't seeing every season.

It's not even just about the ugliness, which some people might enjoy because they find it funny or whatever; I think it's just a dreary ""meh"" most of the time. Pointless season even when it's not being disgusting. (And ""disgusting"" is an understatement.)

Going in, I was really excited for this cast on paper, and I was really sad to see the second contestant get voted out and hope this person returns one day.

Don't skip this unless you truly can't stand a few dark moments which have decent resolution.",2
30.0,Worlds Apart,dbjorq3,"I absolutely adore this season.

This season has some of the best characters in the history of Survivor and I personally consider this to be the funniest season of all time.  There are just so many bright personalities to root for and against.  There's also some solid gameplay here, but ultimately it's a character driven season.

But I will say that you should go in knowing that you will be offended by some of the things that a couple people say.  I especially am not going to downplay one incident of bullying that people were particularly disgusted by, but I will say that you may find the resolution to that storyline quite satisfying.

And the fact that all of my actual favorites went out after the merge and I can enjoy the endgamers *only* ironically? It's still an odd feeling to get used to; I'm not even sure if it detracts from the season for me, but it's worth nothing.

Of course, the first half of the season remains the best thing ever, and all of my thoughts on that are quite in line with one another.",1

There are some positive things, like a select alliance, but its not enough to offset the uncomfortableness.

People hate on it and will ruin your opinion of it.  You may not enjoy it as much as I do, but I assure you, not being a part of the toxic conversation that took place surrounding the season while it was airing will make you enjoy it more.",1
30.0,Worlds Apart,dbmgra8,"Just avoid this cancer at all costs. It's ranked 29th out of 33 for me, so it's not my least favorite season, but this should never be one that you go out of your way to watch.

If you do watch, only watch the pre-merge, and pretend your favorite character left wins. Because the post-merge is so unbearably painful and awkward, that it can kill any first-time viewer's enjoyment of the show.

As a test, I asked my grandmother, a relatively new Survivor fan, to rate each of the seasons she's seen. She's seen everything from Cagayan on.

She can't believe that Worlds Apart existed, in the first place. When I asked her yesterday to list the seasons she's seen, in order of the ones she liked (and then asked her to recall something from each season), the only season she didn't list for having seen (that she has seen) was this season. And when I reminded her this season existed, the only thing she could remember was the worst part of the season.

To me, it's Survivor cancer, and everything the show shouldn't be. It's not the worst season, because it isn't boring like some others. But it isn't one that I think anyone should watch.",1

30.0,Worlds Apart,dbjxhcu,"It's probably my favorite ""bad season"", and I've never understood why people take so much issue with it.  It's not perfect by any means - there are a few moments that are going to be uncomfortable to watch, and a few people take issue with how the season comes to a close.  However, on paper the cast is actually very good - a few duds, sure, but they all contribute to the season's arc.  The winner is (in my opinion) a fantastic character with one of the best winner's stories out there.  I come from the perspective of someone who watched the season after it aired, and supposedly the season was being incredibly hyped and ended up being a letdown for many, but it does tell the kind of story that no other season has ever done.  It's the kind of season that came *this* close to be an absolute disaster but it skirted that line and came out stronger for it.",1

5.0,Thailand,dbjlpji,"Thailand is often called the worst season of the first seven, and most people skip it on a first watch. However, I'm here to praise this season, not to bury it. I was ignorant once too. I never saw the season, but just accepted it to be bad because the mob mentality against it was so strong. Then I sat down and watched it and it was... pretty good. It's nothing amazing and it's got some problems, but it's nowhere near as bad as the majority claims. 

There are a lot of ""unlikable"" characters, but they're not really unlikable, just real. The edit shows and tells it like it is and doesn't manufacture anyone to fill a role. We see a lot of pros and cons with the characters and learn a lot about who they are.

This season is easily one of the funniest too. It's a lot of dark humor, but there's some light hearted stuff in there as well. If you want to laugh a lot and don't mind some fucked up black humor, then I'd highly recommend this season.

For strategy lovers, it has merit for displaying probably the best winning game of the first seven seasons and the winner is personally a fave of mine, though I can understand why they aren't for everyone 

Finally, I love the TONE of this season. It's very ominous, like post-apocalyptic ominous kind of ominous. It's a really surreal feeling to have when watching and it's almost creepy. In fact, this tone makes this probably the least Survivor-like season ever, the Majora's Mask of Survivor if you're a Zelda fan, and it's something you need to experience to believe.

At the end of the day, just give Thailand a chance, please. It's the least viewed season and it needs more appreciation for how unique and surprisingly good it truly is.

**Grade: B**",18
5.0,Thailand,dbjrbkh,"Honestly, I find this season a bit hard to watch. One of the reasons is because, for me, there's a dearth of people to root for and empathize with, even from the very beginning. Nobody really pops off the screen and captures my attention. It has some interesting challenges, many of which have never been repeated, and some interesting gameplay around the merge, which are nice. This is a season best watched in one gasp, because unlike the others, it doesn't necessarily have the personas to draw you back week after week.",4
5.0,Thailand,dbjubd0,"I think Survivor: Thailand best illustrates how differently people can respond to the same seasons. Many people would say ""A lame season, except for the winner, but the winner doesn't make it worth watching""; on the other hand, I feel very strongly that Thailand is worth watching - *except* for the winner, whom I really can't stand. And some people hate the whole thing, and some people love the whole thing.

That said, I don't think Thailand is perfect by any means, and I certainly wouldn't *start* here, or really put it anywhere particularly close to the start if not going chronologically. It plays out in a rather uninteresting way culminating in a somewhat controversial winner. One or two of the episodes do feel like kinda pointless wastes of time, something I can't say about *any* episode before Thailand, and a fair amount of contestants are underedited or forgettable - certainly more than in any of the first four seasons. **It has its flaws, and it isn't the first season I'd show someone trying to get into the show, or even one of the first,** because every single thing I like about it is done better with less drawbacks somewhere else. It's not a standout season of Survivor, and it is by a wide margin the weakest of the first five.

But **it also has its strengths** - strengths that you are missing out on if you just shrug your shoulders and say ""Eh, Thailand's supposed to suck, right? I got no reason to watch it."" Thailand *does* feature some of my all-time favorite characters, some of the most colorful and memorable. Thailand has one of my picks for the best pairs of back-to-back episodes *ever* in the history of the franchise; excluding finales, I can really only think of a couple of pairs that top it, and pretty much none outside of Marquesas/Pearl Islands. It has a long-term tribal narrative that I think is very satisfying and set up very well. It has some super bold production decisions and twists that are really unlike anything that came before. Production-wise - the props and sets and whatnot - it has maybe my favorite aesthetics of every season. And a lot of people do have a great fondness for the polarizing winner.

So no, Thailand isn't perfect, and you shouldn't start here. Or, if you're a more recent fan, this should *definitely* not be your introduction into old-school Survivor. But I feel that it is a lot more fun, daring, and satisfying than it's almost always given credit for being, and if you're a more serious Survivor fan who has already seen most of the seasons, I see no reason why this one should be tossed aside entirely. There are some *really* good things here that for me outweigh the faults and that are definitely worth seeing, even if the faults mean it isn't worth seeing first. I think it adds more good to Survivor canon than bad, and even if you do dislike it when all is said and done, it's certainly not an irredeemable season and it's still worth experiencing the good.

**My Personal Ranking**: 13/32

**Overall verdict**: Do you absolutely, utterly *need* to watch Survivor: Thailand? No. I agree with other commenters that it's the season of the first 7 I think is skippable. But it isn't even close to the *last* season I'd tell someone to watch, and it does have some really colorful characters, great production stuff, and excellent moments that you're totally missing out on if you just write it off. Significantly worse than the first four and not at all a strong representation of old-school Survivor's strengths, but still not bad in my book, and definitely not one of the worst.",7

5.0,Thailand,dbkj45k,"This is the lowest season outside of the Dark Ages to me. Unlikable cast. Unlikable winner. Unlikable Final 2.

Do I hate Thailand? No, I don't really hate any seasons other than One World, Redemption Island and Caramoan. I just dislike it. It definitely has it's high points, but there's just so much general negativity to go around.

The winner did play a game that was *far* ahead of their time, however. That's impressive.

5.0,Thailand,dbmgzkh,"My all-time least favorite season.

It was boring. I watched this one pretty late, it was one of the last seasons I watched, and I entered with no prejudices. After all, I was told that Amazon was amazing, but I didn't leave, loving it.

I tried to give everyone a chance, but this season thankfully, was not my first, or I would have never watched another season.

There are a ton of truly unlikable characters, and two in particular are probably in my top 5 for most detestable. And it's worse, because I can legitimately believe these two people aren't just being edited to look bad.

The strategy in this season isn't terrible, and it might be the best played game by a winner in the first 8 seasons (the first ""era"" of Survivor), but this is about the only redeeming quality I can come out of Thailand with, especially post-merge.

There is one unique case of a character arc with one particular character, that I believe is of note. Rarely do we see people change so much in Survivor, and have a life-changing epiphany. If they have it, it's something they find once they get voted out, or leave the game, or at Ponderosa. This player experiences his life-changing experience out on the island, and is aware of it in the moment. It's especially redeeming because this character was highly unlikable before this moment.

That said, I do think every Survivor fan should see this season at least once. I wouldn't say it's high on the must-watch list, but it's probably somewhere in the middle. This season is probably the least must-watch by nature of how many people return from this season, and the role they play in their future season. It's saving grace in making it a season to watch is the unique tone and narrative the season takes, even if personally, I think it's a dumpster fire that needs to be put out.",2
5.0,Thailand,dbjnk10,"I don’t like when people lump this season in with, like, One World and Redemption Island at the bottom of the barrel, because it has some things going for it. It has some really funny characters and moments, and the editing is fairly solid. There's a very interesting twist halfway through the game that leads to a very fun couple of episodes. But still, there’s lots of predictability, slow episodes and forgettable characters, and the winner is very polarizing to say the least. Not the completely irredeemable mess that many claim it to be, but still the weakest old-school season, and if you don't want to watch every season, it's the one old-school season you can probably skip. I wouldn't skip it myself because it does have some fun stuff, but it's not a must-watch.

It's funny because I've long taken to calling Thailand the ""dark season"" - glad I'm not the only one who thinks so! Something about it is just so... bleak.

It's not an out in the open, intentionally *edgy* type of darkness, but one in which you have to pay very close attention in order to really ascertain where that uncanny feeling of malaise comes from.",1

Thailand's first five episodes are all at least decent (I don't mind *that event* as much as most people though so YMMV) and it's post merge while pretty bad only lasts for about 3 episodes (and even then the third episode in that line-up could be at least decent because of some other stuff.)  Then the season's last two episodes are both good.

The main thing to know is that Thailand is full of dark comedy.  If you like comedy that includes dead bat embryos, and people talking about wanting to commit suicide, you'll be okay with this season.  If you really hate that humor, then you're probably not going to like this season as much.",3

26.0,Caramoan,dbjl40b,"One of these nights, get really drunk. Let yourself go. Get smashed, pissed, wasted, sloshed, schwifty, slizzered, toasted — whatever your culture calls it. And then open up your laptop, boot up a Word document, and start writing a fictional season of Survivor.

Go crazy. Don’t stop. Work those fingers. Don’t look back at your sentences. Just keep chugging along. Type, type, type. Expand the story, move forward, episode after episode, boot after boot. No editing is allowed. Stay up all night working that story, powering through your drunkenness and exhaustion. Continue pushing forward until you’ve written the entire script. Then go to bed.

The next day, print out whatever you have, and without any editing, without looking it over at all, hand it to a friend and say, “Here you go! Here’s a full season of Survivor! Enjoy!”

That’s Caramoan. It’s is first-draft drunken fan fiction.

None of the storylines make any sense. The editing is atrocious. Characters portrayed as bullies morph into lovable underdogs post-merge. Characters shown as strategically dominant suddenly lose all screentime and become pathetic pawns. These huge character shifts occur without any warning, like something from the movie “The Room.”

Caramoan’s negatives are numerous. Multiple characters are immensely unlikable. The pre-merge is an unfun slog of predictable boots and off-putting drama. It contains the single hardest-to-watch scene since Richard Hatch committed sexual assault on national TV. And this scene raises unfortunate questions about choices made by casting and production. Like: why was someone allowed on the show who obviously was suffering significant mental health issues? Is TV entertainment worth risking someone’s complete mental breakdown? Is that entertainment or unnecessarily risky exploitation? And what would the show have done had that terrible moment devolved into actual physical violence?

Elsewhere, character edits are glaringly unbalanced. Some returnees get nearly no screentime, or much of a character arc. One returnee in particular should have stayed home rather than waste their time with their nonexistent edit — despite finishing in the top 5! It’s all very confusing. Others returnees are shamelessly over-edited, even if they’re not particularly likable or entertaining. And the first boot is the most contrived moment on Survivor that doesn’t involve South Pacific contestants being forced to watch “Jack and Jill.” 

You want to talk about winner’s edits? The winner is blatantly obvious from episode 1. They face as much competition as a real NFL team facing the Cleveland Browns. It helps playing with all your friends. There’s even reason to believe that the winner was given certain rewards post-merge in an attempt by production to help this person move forward. The FTC, for being arguably the best scene of the season, is basically a circlejerk of how shitty and unredeemable one contestant apparently was, when in retrospect that contestant was a rather decent, loving human being put in impossible situations by the nature of the game Survivor. Why did we have to humiliate them so publicly and dramatically? That was just cruel.

Caramoan has the worst editing, the worst storyline, the worst overall cast, the worst premerge, the worst F3, and a bottom five winner. Skip it until you’ve watched all other seasons except the final few in this list.",48

A fans vs. favorites season where the fans aren't fans and the favorites aren't favorites. The editing is just disgraceful; arcs are all over the place, with some characters oscillating randomly between hero and villain, some obnoxious production favorites being forced down your throat, and some just being completely invisible. It does have some fans for its number of blindsides and idol usage, some people really like the winner, and there is one character who I absolutely adore, which is more than I can say for One World and Redemption Island. But as a coherent story with good characters, it’s bottom of the barrel.

26.0,Caramoan,dbkldii,"TBH, I actually really like this season.  I realize that this is a very unpopular season due to the editing, and I do agree that there were some editing issues (many of the contestants were relatively ignored), but the main ""characters"" that the season portrayed were the ones that I liked the most.  Does that make me a basic casual fan?  I hope not.

Regardless, there are some really dramatic moments in this season that make it really interesting to me as well, although some of these moments are despised by the fandom for the very reasons that I love them.

I think that there is more to this season than the editing mishaps.  There are some fantastic blindsides and great tribal council moments.  I would say to watch this season with an open mind.  Maybe it shouldn't be at the top of your re-watch list, but it's still a re-watch-worthy season IMO.",5

Simple as that. Well, it's more complicated than that, but that's the main reason. In addition, while the pre-merge is pretty detestable (or so bad it's good if you like trainwreck TV) the post-merge lights up with a lot of fun moves and decent arcs.

Is it a great season? No, you'll probably hate it to death and want to fucking die after watching it, but take it from me and give it a chance. Every season is worth trying once.

There are very few redeeming factors to Caramoan as a season, and a whole lot of things that detract from it.  It has an awful cast (my personal pick for worst cast ever), a bad theme, terrible editing, a poor boot order, one absolutely horrific moment (the only one that approaches a specific moment in All-Stars), boring challenges and a mediocre winner.  Jeff is absolutely awful in terms of how clearly he’s rooting for one contestant.  It’s really everything you’d expect in a bad Survivor season put into one horrifying concoction.  The best way to think about Caramoan is to think about it as if Survivor changed into a typical trashy reality show.  
That being said, it still has its fans.  There is one cast member who far outperforms expectations to become easily the strongest character of the season with a great story.  There are a couple of moments in the early post-merge that are solid on a first watch.  The winner of this season does have fans and if you like them you’ll like this season a lot more.

Gods, *no.* Could honestly beat out RI as my all-time least favorite and is maybe the *last* place I'd start *anyone.* The edit is so disjointed and horrible: almost all of the time is spent on obnoxious characters being shoved down your throats, you're beaten over the head with one forced fan favorite in the post-merge whether you like them or not (and maybe you will, and if so that's awesome!, but the season more or less assumes and insists that you will while other, superior seasons present a wider variety of characters), and the contestants who *aren't* given these major caricatured edits are *almost invariably* made into totally neutral gamebots, given completely random storylines that change erratically with 0 explanation, or just simply ignored. (Or multiple at once, in some cases!) It's just such a mess narratively - and it also has some really, reaaaally uncomfortable moments that leave it as unpleasant as it is sloppy.

It's basically a full collection of almost all the weaknesses a Survivor season can possibly have, and when those weaknesses include a total weirdness to the story, *and* half the cast are returning players... there's no reason to start at this one.

I look at survivor as a chaotic game that can have seasons where things are put into a cohesive perspective, but there are also seasons without it. Not everyone will have an arc, story, or foreshadowing alluding to their down fall. Humans don't work like that so you can't always portray it like that.

It's hard for me to really put this into words since I've never really sat and though about what I do look for in a season that deeply.

I will admit that editing can effect a season poorly for me. I think that this season had to many pre merge boots who got so little screen time that I can't even remember their name.

I think more than anything this season gets a bad rep because it's *frustrating* to watch at times.  I imagine it's why Gabon and Nicaragua get a similar classification as train wreck seasons, but they end up entertaining because *everyone* is playing poorly, and in One World some moves seem obviously poor and it leaves you wondering if several contestants are aware that they're playing Survivor.  

I'd like to argue that the premerge is at least unpredictable to some degree, and more marred by one character (later, two) in particular, but as the merge hits it appears that several players are completely incapable of doing *anything* to benefit themselves, or are simply delusional about where they stand in the game and therefore don't think they *need* to change anything about their downward spiral of a game.  After awhile you hit the point where you notice that only one player is using their brain and the season turns into somewhat of a foregone conclusion.  The winner of the season is certainly respected, but as a TV character is... not getting any praise.

On paper, the cast of this season is... *good*, but it's the kind of season that isn't chock full of enjoyable gameplay and has very few character moments to fill in those gaps.

It contains the worst *underdog* story of all time imo. It contains annoying characters aplenty (my least favorite cast, even).

Hell, the postmerge, while better than the premerge, is not even too much better because it's just so lifeless and boring.

Watch it if you want to see a masterclass on how to win Survivor, though. The winner truly did play one of, if not the best game of all time. That's the only reason I can think of that you would want to watch.

Dynamic gameplay that's entertaining but doesn't dominate the season. Has a fun theme that's integrated with the game in a more organic way that they have ever managed before or since.

There's a fairly controversial twist midway through that's absolutely unfair if that's something that bothers you. It is near-universally agreed that this twist ultimately worked out for the best even though it by most accounts shouldn't have.

Worth nothing that it spoils the winner of S28: Cagayan in the tribal council in the 3rd episode, a few minutes into the tribal. Personally, I think this is still a better staring point than almost any other season including Cagayan, but if you’re particularly spoiler averse just make sure to be careful in that one scene, and maybe skip ahead to the voting if you’re particularly scared of being spoiled.

- A tremendous pre merge which sets up the arcs of the season perfectly, leading to a three episode stretch in the early post merge that is among the best run of episodes in recent memory.

There is engaging strategy and gameplay, some huge shockers, and some profoundly emotional scenes. But most importantly, there is a huge, blood red heart beating at the center of this story. 

Kaoh Rong is a season that fits in both the modern era and is refreshingly ""old school."" This comes warmly recommended. ",3

There's many scenes throughout that show emotion, whether about other contestants or family, that makes you feel like you know that person better.

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,dis3ycn,"Kaôh Rōng is an example of new school done right. The game is utterly unpredictable, the challenges are epic, the tribal councils are dramatic, the players are all interesting people, and the entire game is just fascinating to watch play out.

I didn't like the editing, it felt unbalanced and not a great narrative. I found it a truly middle of the road season. Worth watching of course, but I don't recommend getting to it for awhile. I personally rank it 25... Unpopular opinion I know.",2

12.0,Panama,diooum3,"Personally one of my favorite seasons. Panama is one of the more... offbeat seasons of Survivor, and it features probably the single most dysfunctional tribe in the series. Lots of Seinfeldian conversations and arguments ensue. The cast has a pretty giant amount of zany, wacky characters, but also a ""straight man"" or two as well as one of the more legendary players ever playing for their first time, so pretty much everyone can find someone to root for. 

Maybe don't watch it *first*, but Panama definitely deserves a watch early on. It's hilarious and just turns out genuinely good.",25
12.0,Panama,diou2ij,"It's a divide of tribes, with one being very dry and one being extremely dynamic. You will know which one is which very quickly. However, get those tribes to mix, and it is fantastic TV. A lot of true characters and birth of stars with gameplay taking a backseat to it. It can also be uproariously funny. ",8

One of the most beloved and acclaimed players of all time came out of this season, and if you love stories of growth and evolution, you'll love their story. It also features what is probably one of the most famous and well-received tribe line-ups in Survivor history. Expect the unexpected and you'll see what I mean. It has plenty of colorful characters and stories, and it also has a lot of comical value and emotional moments. The Exile Island twist makes for some interesting storylines. Panama is a beloved season by fans of the show for a reason.

12.0,Panama,diou4db,"<3 SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!<3

For some fans, this season ranks among the all-time greats for the comedy alone. This has some of the biggest, funniest characters and scenes that you could hope for in a Survivor season. While this season does have a fair share of under-edited and ultimately irrelevant players, the big characters do more than make up for it. One of the most beloved and important players to this day has their origin in this season, and their story is one you owe it to yourself to experience. In addition, this season features returning players in quite a few other seasons, so it's a good one to be familiar with for that as well.

This is also the first season to introduce a (comparatively) large number of big game changes at the same time, in the four tribe format and the introduction of Exile Island, and, most importantly, the Hidden Immunity Idol. 

If you're not watching chronologically, I recommend Panama/EI sooner than later. ",4

If you want to watch a funny season, Philippines and Cagayan are much better choices.",1

12.0,Panama,dip8vzp,"It's a really fun, funny season that provides tons of laughs and crazy people. There's two tribes, one with the characters with those traits, and one without. Both are good. One has the crazy stuff, while the other is a bit more strategic and serious. It's a nice divide. Great cast overall. The strategy is a little thrown off to the side at times, but it always pops it's head out when appropriate. 

**Positives - Humour, cast of crazy and wacky people properly developed, strategy, great moments**

**Negatives - God Idol. Lacks a story.**

I wouldn't recommend it first, it doesn't have the storylines or strategy I'd want a new viewer to see. ",1
12.0,Panama,diqgbzp,"One of only a handful of seasons I've watched thrice. There is a narrative that half the cast is boring but it's only because they're being compared to the other half of the cast who are some of the most entertaining people to ever be thrown together on an island in front of cameras. In reality, it's a great cast all around and fun moments in every episode. 10/10. ",1
12.0,Panama,diqj1sl,"This season features arguably the most entertaining tribe of all time but is not entirely as good as that sounds since there's also the other tribe and that gets annoying. Probably the most entertaining one from a pure clash of personalities perspective. Also one of my favorite opening episodes of all times which feels like Survivor on crack (high praise to me). Definitely a season worth watching but perhaps better appreciated when you're already familiar with the really old school seasons and how different this one feels at points.

Birthplace of a TOP5 Survivor character that goes on to return many times and three more returnees. One of the characters - who has not returned yet - also regularly tops lists of people who fans want to come back and for good reason.

I will also mention that for my money this season has one of the best, if also one of the oddest, art directions.",1
12.0,Panama,dis5r90,"If I had to describe Panama in one word that word would be ""unlikely"". Simply put, so many things in this season were unlikely. First and foremost: this season was unlikely to be good. There is no way that two extremely strange and new twists should have worked out to be this good, there should have been no way that the more neurotic castaways would be such huge characters, there should have been no way for a fascinating story line to develop post merge like it did. Along with this: one entire tribe can just be called ""unlikely"" and I'll leave it at that for spoilers.

But all those things did happen and what you end up with is a very good season of Survivor. Sure, the main narratives, winner, challenges, location, strategy, and the majority of the cast were all nothing special. But the other half, and most of the people who made the merge made this season what it was, in particular one tribe that pretty much has a chokehold on all time favorite tribe. Panama took all of your favorite nutballs from seasons like Gabon and Tocantins and tuned them down to be just crazy enough to be believable (except maybe one character who kinda got cranked up on the crazy scale).

**5/15**",1
12.0,Panama,dj7imrw,"Underrated season IMO.  I enjoyed the tribe splits, and the post merge alliance that was like a dysfunctional family was very fun to watch.  Not only that, but a very solid rivalry between two competitors who both had very different kinds of ""protection"" made it fun to see play out to the end.",1
12.0,Panama,dioo7ls,"Panama is a great season if you enjoy lots of wacky characters and silly humor. Personally, I tend to prefer seasons with more normal, relatable people, but I still found a few people that I cared about this season. Strategy-wise, there isn’t a lot going on for the most part, outside of one very interesting and crafty player.

My Ranking:  **21/34**

If you’re looking for lots of strategy and relatable characters, this isn’t a great season, but it is still an adequate one. If you’re not big on strategy and you really like wacky characters, you’re gonna love Panama.",1
18.0,Tocantins,diop3jc,"With Tocantins, production set up a season that is a wonderful blend of ""old school"" and ""new school"" (or maybe at this point it's more accurate to say ""middle school""). It is the last season to have only 16 contestants, so the editing is a bit more even and the pacing less rushed. 

Tocantins is noted for the first real ""mega character"" in Survivor history. They will extremely annoying if you take them seriously, but absolutely fantastic if you don't. Additionally, there are several other strong characters.

The Ponderosa videos for this season are a blast as everyone gets along, no matter how much they argued inside the game.",28
18.0,Tocantins,diov4gl,"Tocantins is very similar to China in that it's a season that solidly blends ""new"" and ""old"" school to great effect. Among it's old school elements are it's small, developed cast and it's one-of-a-kind setting that is almost a character of it's own. The tropical savannah of Central Brazil is among the game's most breathtaking backdrops--especially the swelling dunes of Exile Island. It is often referred to as a ""slow burn"" season. Some of the earlier episodes may not feel as eventful, but Tocantins does an excellent job of setting up it's dominoes in a way that makes them exhilarating to watch when they finally start to fall.

This season hosts a number of deeply loved characters, 3 of which are players who will return 2 more times each, so it's a good one to watch as you prepare to take in the more returnee heavy era of the show. ",15
18.0,Tocantins,diot4fe,"Tocantins is, at its core, a very back-to-basics season of Survivor.  And it fulfills that purpose well.

Except for one certain character, who is just the most larger-than-life character Survivor has ever cast.  And it's glorious.

Because of this character, wait until you get more Survivor context to watch this one.

Watch if: You want a good blend of old-school and new-school characters, You love over-the-top characters.",10

This cast is one of the best of all time, and it is the last ever season to feature a 16 person cast, which leads to each person getting a decent amount of airtime. Tocantins is an absolutely beautiful setting. Tocantins best strength is its character development. The characters are very well fleshed, and there is much variety in terms of the roles they all play in the season. The pre-merge may not be super exciting, but the tribes are both interesting enough to keep things entertaining. Once the post-merge hits there is a lot of reshuffling in regards to the dynamics of the players, and every episode in the post-merge is absolute gold. There are huge character moments, big blindsides, extremely likable underdogs, fantastic villains, and emotional scenes that will make you very passionate about your feelings on much of the cast. Many of the cast members from the post-merge are extremely popular in the survivor community. If you want a season with a fantastic cast and location with many satisfying and crazy moments and developed characters, then this is a season I highly recommend!

18.0,Tocantins,diqkotp,"Tocantins is a great season that, while not necessarily being the best anything, serves as one of the best introductions to the show I can think of (especially for those who don't have the time or patience for a chronological watch).

This season, while located solidly in the middle of the show's run so far, harkens back to the more classic seasons of Survivor with a smaller cast, very limited amount of twists and a focus on location (which is one of the most beautiful they have ever visited).

Notably features a larger than life castaway whose legend slowly grows through the season to reach a point where the editors connect so many little jokes to him they basically break the fourth wall. This castaway can be somewhat controversial and it's good to take him with some levity.

Even ignoring him this season is the home of one of the most iconic friendships on the show, a variety of fun underdog stories and generally a perfectly balanced merge cast.

Features four future returnees who between themselves heavily impact five future returnee seasons. ",2
18.0,Tocantins,dior7hf,"It's another easy, calming watch, though it does have a few elements that I would find weird if I were just starting out watching this show. While the next season is described as when the modern form of the show was born, I would describe this as its pregnancy. Sure, the elements are largely traditional and this is possibly the last truly unique location, but through occasionally clever usage of twists and a focus on more ""scripted"" creator's pets and characters of less dimension, you can see it starting to head towards the elements of modern seasons that you may have seen air today- for better or worse. Still, sitting back from that all, it is very relaxed and less likely to get your heartrate up, so it's a good rainy day season",2
18.0,Tocantins,dipadmp,"This is my 1b season. Last WSSYW, it was my #1, but Vanuatu has passed it.

Tocantins has similar strengths. It has a good, but not great pre-merge, but picks up steam throughout the merge. There's one huge character that I really like, and he's what the season revolves around. He's a bit out there, oddball, crazy, probably an act? Just don't take any of it seriously. I love the conflict that happens in this season, there's some traditional yelling at each other, but the victim in each instant doesn't just die, but they come back. It creates a really good, balanced conflict that helps both characters. This season is also good if you're looking for laughs, there's quite a bit of snark and dry humor. The strategy in this season isn't always in the forefront, but it's always there, and mixes with everything really well. 

**Positives - Very entertaining throughout, the cast is developed well, and even the more minor characters have reasons to like, consistently funny, and mixes the crazy with logical strategy quite well.**

**Negatives - If you don't like one character, you're unlikely to like the season.**

If you wanted to not start at the beginning, and wanted a more middle season to show you the best of both worlds, this is it. ",1

18.0,Tocantins,dis5jp3,"I viewed Gabon and Tocantins back to back and I would recommend everyone does the same. Coming off that season Survivor needed to reestablish itself as not just an episode of Jerry Springer in the jungle. Tocantins is the producers of Survivor taking all that was right with Gabon and going ""lets slow down a bit here guys"". That's really what you are getting with Tocantins, a return to normalcy from the show.

The rest of what happened in the show was up to the characters and they did marvelous. This season presents one of the all time great bromances along with an incredible underdog narrative. You have ever-shifting alliances and several tribal councils where what is going to happen isn't obvious and actually is incredibly shocking not just to the players but also to the viewers. You have an absolutely insane character. You also have what I consider to be an extreme downer of a FTC, however stick around for the reunion show and a lot of what sucks about it is redeemed.  Tocantins is an honest to god great season with its well balanced and likable cast, along with its interesting strategy. Watch it towards the beginning.

I was going to say this. Back when I first watched this season I thought about a certain person as being way too over the top for TV. and it kind of put me off. Now I find them hilarious. 

I'm going to write my own thoughts here rather than making another comment. Tocantins is a bit of a wild unexpected ride. The location is stunning and the cast is a blast. The winning game is super unique and probably not possible again. 

I also like that it was old school in that there was very few game changing twists. ",10

15.0,China,dioqi5j,"Probably the safest season to start with. It strikes a balance between modern, twist-dominated gameplay, but it never gets so overwhelming as to be unfair or overwhelm the strength of the characters. Also, it gets my pick for being the funniest season, through both some obvious castmates, some forgotten ones, and the fact that it seems to have made a bet with itself to cram a funny into every minute of the season. Nothing gets too serious other than a few hotly debated quips towards the end, but the strength of the humor and the generally lighthearted feel makes it stand out as an easy watch. ",36
15.0,China,dioz6zj,"What /u/ExtraLifeBalloon said. This season is the most balanced ever, and unlike MvGX where its very much trying to find what it wants to be, it's smaller roster allows for EVERY character to shine, and is not only likeable, but ENTERTAINING.

It's probably one of 10 seasons where you likely wouldn't know who would win from the start, and I love it for that as well.",8
15.0,China,dioszs6,"This is my personal favorite season, and is a season that has been at or near the top of the WSSYW thread in almost every version for very good reason. China is often described as a blend of “old” and “new” school Survivor, making it great for new viewers as it gives them a chance to see a lot of what Survivor has to offer and help them determine what they are most engaged by in the show. China also has a very unique location, with production doing an excellent job of integrating elements of Chinese culture into the challenges, set design, and rewards. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, China is beloved for having one of the strongest casts in the history of the series. No two contestants in this 16 player cast feel redundant. Everyone has unique characterization and a role in the story (some larger than others), making it easy for viewers to follow the action and engage in the story. Whether you are considering trying Survivor for the first time; a new fan looking to watch more seasons; or a long-time fan who just hasn’t seen it yet; China comes warmly recommended. ",7

The casting for this was a small miracle in that you really get people from all walks of life, geographically, socially and ethnically speaking. They also end up filling every imaginable slot you can expect from a good reality tv season - you've got your schemers, your snarkers, your buffoons, your scrappy underdogs, your team moms, your over-confident villains, your crazy people and your living dead all in one place.

25.0,Philippines,diovvu6,"Watching this season will obviously spoil the evacuations of the three returning players in their earlier seasons, so if you are really, really spoiler-averse, hold off. Otherwise Philippines is a great place to start/ do early, as unlike in most other seasons featuring returning players, this one doesn't require you to know much about them beyond the fact they were evacuated the last time they played.

It popularized the now fairly standard 3 tribe format and is still one of the best to feature it. This season features some great and unique heroes and some fantastic villains. Unlike many other seasons that mix newbies with returning ""captains,"" the new players aren't underdeveloped in favor of the old guard. In addition, it has some really strong and often quite funny secondary and background characters.

This season is also fondly remembered for yanking Survivor by the throat out of it's worst string of seasons ever, so if you're watching chronologically, congratulations--you're getting closer to the promise land. ",16

The beginning is unusual, but in a very good way.  The season then settles more into normalcy a few episodes in, but it's still very good.  Two characters, one of whom appears two more times, stand out in particular.

I think that's a shame. This is one of my favorite casts ever, with one tribe in particular being fantastic. The first four episodes make up the best four episode stretch ever, and the rest of the season is barely worse. There's so much to like here and I strongly recommend it to anyone. I will admit that part of my love for the season is because the winner is in my top five favorite castaways",10

Yes, it has returning players, but you really can watch this without knowing them, if you don't mind mild spoilers of previous seasons (you can still absolutely go back and enjoy their previous seasons after watching this--the winners aren't spoiled or anything). I think this season has the most solid cast of any, with so many people you'll be rooting for and so many you'll be dying to see fail. Fantastic storytelling, just a touch of meta discussion...really all in all one of my very favorite seasons, without a lot of twists or complicated add-ons that make it unwelcoming for newcomers. ",2

One of the tribes gets my pick for best tribe ever- their story is well told not only as individuals but as a tribe which rarely happens. While outside of that it feels disappointingly like business as usual, the other two tribes do pull their weight and are very fun to watch. A lot of dynamic shifts and focus on character and the utilization of three returning captains that finally gets a mixed season right. ",1

That said, this season is well-liked among the community, by both hardcore and more casual watchers.  There are great heroes, villains, and plot-lines that come into play.

I think the post-merge falls apart a little because the editing goes sour, but it's still enjoyable.

For any people that have watched a few seasons and love the strategy aspects, I recommend this season highly.  For anyone that loves big characters, I recommend this season.  For anyone that prefers the older, slower seasons, I recommend that you watch this season... down the road.

If you do decide to start with this season, understand that this is not the speed of every season and that this season plays on expectations set by other seasons.  Oh, and this season massively spoils Season 21: Nicaragua in the finale so...

28.0,Cagayan,diopfd3,"Cagayan is, just like Kaoh Rong, a pretty great season to start with if you want to quickly get into new-school Survivor. When I've shown a few of my friends Cagayan, I've found that their enjoyment of the season hinges on their enjoyment of a few big polarizing characters, since much of the season is focused on said few. There are a ton of unique contestants though, and whether you're a fan of character moments or strategy you'll find someone to enjoy. My favorite modern contestant comes from this season, and there are some really intriguing casting choices. 

Overall I've seen mostly positive reception, and the Brains vs Brawn vs Beauty twist is a fun one that doesn't affect the season TOO much but makes it easy for first-time viewers to distinguish the tribes.

 It opens with the best premiere episode of all time.

By the time the merge hits, you think the season can't get any better, but it does. The merge episode features the best tribal council in Survivor history. The very next episode features an insane idol hunt. For the rest of the post-merge, there is an amazing battle between 2 complex and likable players. Innovative straggles are pioneered. One player becomes one of the best to ever play the game. And lest you worry it's all about strategy, there are plenty of hilarious character moments too.

The characters this season are amazing. Every single player is memorable and well-developed. The winner is phenomenal and his/her game is constantly referenced.

My goodness, I could praise this season all day. I've probably said enough by now to convince you this is a fantastic season if you haven't seen it. One more thing: the finale is imo the best Survivor episode of all-time.

There are two all-time great characters here, and a character who most people either love or hate.

Not in my top 20, let alone my top 3, and at any rate, it's definitely not anywhere near a season I'd recommend someone start with. Other seasons have similar strengths while highlighting far more of what can be great about the show, and this one also sets expectations that most other seasons won't meet - not in the sense that it's so good other seasons won't live up to it, just that it's very different in some respects.",3

**Positives- Strategy, has two top tier characters, fast-paced, some very good episodes.**

**Negatives- Unbalanced editing is the biggest flaw. Some episodes are top tier, others are boring and uneventful. Some contestants are top tier, but there's also contestants who are bottom tier.**

The pre-merge is amazing and does set a good tone for the rest of the season. However, the post-merge falls flat after the merge boot due to editing not being as great as the pre-merge had been. Regardless, this is a must-watch season if for no other reason than just because six people play again over a course of two seasons. But, I could watch this season over and over again.

However, do not start with this season. Firstly because half of the players are returning players and you would benefit from watching their previous seasons to get a good sense of what their previous experiences were like. Watching this season first will spoil several other seasons. Also the Blood vs Water twist (which I like) and redemption island (which I don't like) makes this season function differently from any other season.

Heroes vs. Villians is everything an all-star season should be and a fantastic way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Survivor. You have villians acting heroically with one of the biggest face turns in history and heroes acting villainously with one of the most unsuspected heel turns in history. You also have castaways acting incredibly stupid... you'll see.

Additionally, you get exactly what you'd expect out of so many lovable and hateable characters appearing in a single season. One of the most hateable characters ever becomes even more hateable and one of the most lovable characters becomes even more lovable. Additionally, in this season, you kind of get a refinement of what Survivor is. The characters, while being the same characters, are the archetypes we've loved forever, and the strategies for the most part stay the same while only getting better. In all, with Heroes vs. Villains, you get exactly what it says on the tin. You get the biggest villains facing up to the end with the biggest heroes.

As hugely character and story driven season, SJDS does have a reputation for being polarizing--there are absolutely viewers who thought this season was just *terrible.* Much of this is due to SJDS pretty firmly being a ""character"" season on the strategy/character spectrum, so your level of investment will likely depend on how much you like that kind of Survivor and how much you like the individual castaways.

There are many format twists to this season that make it very unlike the ""average"" Survivor season. Between that and it's nature as a more specific ""type"" of season, I'd recommend having a few seasons under your belt before stopping here.",12

Despite its reputation as a conflict-free season, there's a lot of us vs them.

Palau explores some of the darker sides of Survivor, and the season can feel emotionally heavy and hard to watch at times, but in a way that most fans find extremely moving and worthwhile.

It has a story line that has never been seen in another season, and to figure it out you just need to watch.  However, this story line is not the complete focus of the season.  This season is often regarded as a 2 in 1 package, since the pre-merge and post-merge are so different from each other.  This season has a fantastic second half that is fueled through excellent character development throughout the season, and a strong focus on the relationships between members of the cast.  The end of this season is extremely dark and unforgettable, and you will not see any of it coming until you get to the finale.  I highly recommend Palau.

I like the pre-merge better than most, there's some good development of the post-mergers, as well as the fact that the pre-mergers have some really good characters among them. The post-merge has the greatest relationships, and shows how Survivor can take their toll on someone's mind. The post-merge is just so compelling and shows the darker parts of the emotional sides of Survivor, and it's very serious in tone. Not to say there isn't any funny stuff that goes on, but the stuff that you laugh at isn't exactly lighthearted jokes. Once you get to the post-merge, you'll want to keep going to the next episode. 

**Positives - Cast, character development, relationships, morals and emotions, the effects on mental health, the finale (best one ever), WW2 theme**

**Negatives - It's deeper than most seasons, and it may not be what you want in Survivor.**

Lots of meaningful blindsides and memorable tribals. And probably the funniest reunion show of all-time.

Your view of this season may depend on a few things. First and foremost, do you enjoy individual characters or the ensemble as a whole? If you answered ensemble this season may not be the right one as half the cast can be thrown out by editing as soon as possible. Which really what did CBS expect, as Penner said ""You don't want to play against the Red Sox"". Second, how do you like certain characters from past seasons? Some come out looking a bit better, some come out looking a bit (or a lot) worse, some come out looking the same, and some of the most exciting returnees make extremely quick exits.

Do you like explosive, exciting strategy? Do you like to be kept guessing? Do you like injuries upon injuries? Do you like hidden immunity idols and general idiocy? If you answered yes to all those questions keep watching.  While Micronesia did have one of the best (and most satisfying) strategic plays of all time, the rest of the season, the complete disregard of one tribe and the way the returnees come out looking, make this season a bit bitter for me.

I absolutely hate the theme and feel that it drastically weakens a lot of the season, however, like all themes, there is only so long they can be much of a focus as you get to know the people in the cast more as individuals. The pre-merge is rather dated, but not totally lacking in appeal. The post-merge is pretty good, and I doubt anyone would watch this season and have negative feelings overall to the latter half. It's pretty comfortable in its entertainment value.

In terms of strategy, this is an incredibly important season. Those watching in order will easily be able to see why, those who aren't may still be able to anyway, since it feels like it's clear who is and who isn't changing the game in this season. Also, the location is really unique.

It calms down around the merge once they start shoving the men vs. women thing so hard, but it can be rough to get through until then. Works great as a historical artifact both on Survivor strategy and just how much has changed in the past 15-ish years...but it makes me uncomfortable just watching it at face value for entertainment.",4

You also have probably the second person to really try and be a comedian in all of his confessionals and have (IMO) successful results. It's one of the seasons that will make you laugh the most and the dynamics between the players are all very entertaining.

I remember reading that back on the 5th ""which season to watch"" thread and thinking ""Well, that's funny"", I didn't realize how accurate it was. It seems like the producers took this season and said ""Can we just have somebody fuck this season please?"". You have an EXTREMELY good looking cast that is secluded from the other sex for weeks on end and then are paired up together in ridiculous ways that Survivor begins to resemble a dating game at points... seriously it seems like a middle school boy wrote this season. With that being said, the cast proved to be more than just muscles and curves, they continue to push the strategy much as the Marquesas cast did and some of the cast members are just down right charming.

Post-merge a lot of the misogynist leanings of the season give way to some geniunely compelling gameplay and the puppetmaster of this season is not only a great character but also a great player. Unfortunately, the end game elements of this season are all in my opinion disappointing. This also has the most ridiculous instance of Probst taking the votes back to America. In all, the strategy of this season made me love it.

I never thought it was very fair to use this twist (and, perhaps more importantly, the comments it provoked from some cast members) as a sleight against the season.

It just seems like a LOT of people bring that up as the one 'big' negative of Amazon, when (IMO) it doesn't even come close to marring the surface of an otherwise-great season. I guess I just find it offputting that a few icky/disagreeable comments made early in the season are tainting its reputation simply because the topic in question is a hot-button issue at the moment. I can't imagine any other scenario where a grand total of *maybe* 15 minutes of content in a season of 14 hourlong episodes would hold such sway over that season's overall reputation.

What makes Borneo special is the cast and the social interactions between the players. The cast of Borneo is probably the greatest cast ever assembled, and it needed to be. The producers took great care to pick a diverse group of people and pretty much anybody can find someone to relate to.

Borneo was not just a season of Survivor. It was *the* season and was a pop culture moment that changed the face of television. This is the game in it's rawest form, the show in it's rawest form, and a season with a cast that, to this day, some fans feel is the best ever assembled.

It's interesting to see how the views were, and how they are now regarding the game. And also, the cast is awesome. Each one has their own unique personality, charm and relationship with others.

Instead of being a strategy-heavy season, Gabon is very much emotion and character-driven.  That's not to say there isn't any strategy, there is, but it often takes a back seat to more emotion-based decisions.  The cast is very good with many love 'em or hate 'em type characters.  There is a lot of humor, there are a lot of tears, and most importantly, there is no shortage of entertainment.

The location also contributes to the unique character of this season, with Gabon providing a beautiful landscape that offers a nice change of pace from the more typical island/beach locales.  In addition, the topography lends itself to some unique and inspired challenges we haven't seen elsewhere.

I just finished a re-watch of Gabon the other day which served to further cement its place as one of my favorite seasons of Survivor.

Gabon is nothing short of one of the more memorable seasons of Survivor if not for the Michael Bay-esque ""Everything is blowing up and awesome""-ness of it all. Sure, the backstabs, blindsides, twists, and boot order is awesome, but take all of that together and something is loss. Just like a good action movie isn't all explosions, a good Survivor season isn't all larger than life characters and big moves.

One tribe isn't like super powered over the other etc. The challenges which have become kind of bland in recent seasons are pretty interesting too one of them they have to push a heavy rock, another carry some heavy thing, all this requires massive team work and endurance and the weak aren't able to hide in this season. Some seasons have coasters, but because of the elements if you were weak it was exposed and you weren't able to ""hide"" in the background in this season.",11
3.0,Africa,diotr7l,"A lot of early game Africa is dominated by two schisms that are more bloody and hateful than we ever see, and a lot of gameplay is driven by that. It does disappear towards the end, but the love of location is beyond what we see in most Survivor and makes even the slowest slogs of it feel worthwhile and interesting. ",4
3.0,Africa,dip1vjr,"Survivor, in the literal sense. The difficulty of surviving is pushed to the extreme here.",2
3.0,Africa,dip4pru,"Africa is the last of what I would call the true origins of Survivor. It's a very survivalist season, as well as a season that has real, organic conflicts. The cast is a very good mix of all different types of people. I don't usually care much for challenges, but Africa's challenges were amazing. 

**Positives - Survival elements, nature, conflict of different values, cast**

**Negatives - No standouts. Everything's solidly good, but nothing stands out.**

This season is towards the bottom half of the seasons I really like, but I still like it, and recommend it. ",2
3.0,Africa,dipy5hj,"Watching chronologically, Africa was the first season I truly loved.  The cast is incredible, featuring one of the all-time great starting tribes, one of my personal favorite winners as well as my favorite alliance of all time.  The location is absolutely gorgeous, and it impacts the season in many ways.  Add that to the fact that this season has by far the best rewards and you get a season that I find nearly flawless.  Definitely in my top-tier and I had it at #1 for a very long time.",2

I would recommend this season to anyone and everyone who likes survivor.",1
3.0,Africa,dioyyed,"Africa is a bit of an odd season.  It is quite character based because the plot centers around people's feelings for each other.  It is known for being the first season with an official ""twist"", even when it's not considered one by today's standards.

This season is great when it comes to plot-line and pay-off, but it's not the most pleasant season.  The location is very unique, huts surrounded by thorn-bushes; the cast regularly comes into contact with African wildlife.  But, the season is not the best to look at overall.  Some characters can be grating, and some events are a bit odd to look back at, but it's a great starting point, especially if you want some newer seasons to see what the show used to be like and how it evolved.

3.0,Africa,dipg9zs,"There is no other season in which the setting is so commonly spoken of as ""the 17th character"" in this exemplary season, which takes everything definitive of ""old school"" Survivor and performs them to their best. Kenya is as beautiful as it is deadly. The interactions between wildlife and local culture and the castaways in this season are in a league of their own--as is the deprivation the castaways undergo in one of the harshest settings in Survivor's canon. 

This season is definitely anchored by some very strong characters, who continue the trend of defining the archetypes with which we know Survivor. There are some very funny moments and some characters for everyone--complex leads, scrappy underdogs, villains that are easy to hate, heroes that are easy to love. Keep in mind much of the gameplay in this season is impacted by a game rule that is patched in the following season, meaning that some of the approach we see here is really one of a kind. ",1
3.0,Africa,dipnntd,"I actually really like this season and still have some nostalgia even for this one. I liked the location more than most, and there are still some really good characters and storylines in this one. Not as good as the first two, but definitely worth a watch.",1
3.0,Africa,dis6p6v,"The strategy resembles Gabon more than it resembles China and the alliances are clunky and in some cases just downright idiotic. You have a tribe that is just about middle of the road and than another tribe that is 50% infuriatingly stupid, then 40% ok and then 10% grumpy old man that comes across as pretty misogynistic. Which brings up a problem with old Survivor that I don't think is breached too often. In earlier seasons, Marquesas, Africa, the Amazons, the cast can sometimes be misogynistic, racist, or homophobic. With that being said, looking at Africa as a relic of the past, it isn't a terrible season. You have the birth of some legendary castaways and the beginnings of strategic plans that will reach their full potential when implemented next season in Marquesas.

Another thing that has to be mentioned when discussing Africa is the setting. The use of culture and setting is unparalleled. And Africa is terribly brutal all around, the cast is always drained and exhausted and it really feels like they are out there surviving. In this way, Africa is also one of the last seasons where survival is the main focus. Africa is a transitional point, from not-a-game Survivor to just-a-game Survivor.

3.0,Africa,dip3drb,"I basically had to force myself to finish this season. I found it to be very boring. Sorry, old school fans!",-1
3.0,Africa,dipge3l,I agree with you. I find in certain ways it was really good. For the survival aspect and for the the challenges in that season. I find it more dated than some of the modern seasons though.,2
3.0,Africa,diorl4h,That wasn't featured it was a surprise and prob is considered a spoiler ,2
3.0,Africa,dipgznl,I truly think some of the players legit hated some of the others. At one point someone says a comment about something then at the next tc a juror does something to speak out to comment without saying a word. If something like that happened today social media would prob explode. There's also some very vicious people that are downright hated there's no sugar coating it downplaying it etc. Like you said if that outdated rule wasn't in place it's a different season. ,2
3.0,Africa,dipgsc1,Definitely more dated more recent seasons don't really focus on the keep the tribe strong dynamic like this season does. However my point was in more recent seasons people aren't pushed to the limit like this pushing some heavy rock or living 2 inches away from a lion. Some people were really exposed and dispatched quickly when they weren't. More recent seasons it seems like everyone is trying to make a move for the sake of it. One point in this season one person turns and they are seen as like the devil when in retrospect in some recent seasons people turned multiple times and were respected for it. Bottom line keeping the strongest tribe together was apparent in this season while in newer some of the weaker players were kept around because it they were liked personally. Also the winner of this season is super obvious it never seems like they ever think of voting this person out at any point. ,1
3.0,Africa,diotjq0,"Alright, I will delete it then.",1
3.0,Africa,diph6l4,Ya this season is the true test of survival unlike the rest. I was referring more to the editing feeling slower and more unpolished. It feels the most dated out of all the first seasons IMO. And I agree about the gameplay and the winner. The winner was very likeable though.,1
33.0,MvGX,dioscnf,"A lot of your enjoyment of this season depends on what you're looking for in a season. It's a very meta season with a lot of hyper-awareness among the players about their standing in the game and the moves they need to make. There's a strong level of sportsmanship and the entire cast gets along really well; even with the various rivalries among some cast members, there's very little personal drama, and the season doesn't have a villain or antagonist. If that sounds like something you'd enjoy, go ahead and give it a watch, but if not, you might struggle to get through it.",21
33.0,MvGX,diook9k,"While the season starts with some obnoxious references to the gimmick (eg ""I'm a millennial so I am expected to do this!"", ""You're a millennial, you are expected to do this!""), they fade out after only a few episodes so if that is grating to you, just hang in there.

Afterwards, it turns into a really good season with a great cast and an edit that will leave you guessing up until the very end. 

Very good season, would recommend it as a first season to watch, maybe only after Cagayan.",20
33.0,MvGX,dioqiiv,Yes the theme is forced. No that doesn't make it a bad season! I personally loved the cast and think quite a few have the potential to return (a man can hope). One of the players from the season is active on reddit! Great watch.,10
33.0,MvGX,dip329f,"This season is quite strategy-discussion heavy.  Many people think it has a good cast, but I consider it more hit-or-miss.  But the main problem I have with this season is that it feels a little impersonal.  It feels like there is less at stake and that this is a bunch of friends who want to win for personal pride than a million dollars.

If less drama-heavy seasons are your thing, or you like strategy discussion, you'll find this season better than I'm describing.  I would recommend to a new viewer though, despite my comments.

33.0,MvGX,dipx7hc,"I have a feeling that this season will not be remembered fondly a few years from now. Sure, there's a charming cast and some interesting strategic developments. But it also has one of the dumbest themes ever, buries good character development under hyper/meta-strategic narratives, and culminates in a truly puzzling final tribal council.  A harmlessly fun season in the end, but probably not worth your time if you're looking for something truly great to start with. ",3
33.0,MvGX,diosb96,"While I thought the pre-merge, despite the forced, awful theme, was pretty good, I almost completely lost interest in the season after the merge. Most of the cast is really underdeveloped and one note, meaning that if you don't like a person's sole schtick, they're either annoying or boring. 

And even then, the editing is pretty bad too. Storylines just come out of nowhere and fall out of existence for no reason and there are some really confusing moments where they tell you rather than show you what you need to know, which never really works out.

The season is very meta too, with big moves and resume talk being a huge annoyance in the second half. It really drains the life out of season, and given how bland and undramatic most of the cast is, it leaves several characters as huge game bots with little character development, and others with nothing to do or say as they linger as background figures.",9
33.0,MvGX,dioval0,"I have not fully made up my mind on this season. It has a lot of what I want in a season- genuine storylines, standout characters, and a focus on the human aspect as well as strategic heft- but it feels very shallow, in large part because few characters carry that heft well. There's a focus on the gimmick at first that drags the season down and delays us getting to those human, genuine aspects that are kind of weaksauce, more than they should be. Plus, up until Episode 5 the season stretch is honestly one of the weakest opening stretches I can think of. That being said, it does get better towards the middle-end and I honestly think there is an episode around there that is legitimately one of the top twenty ever, and completely made me positive on a character I was down on until then. ",6
33.0,MvGX,diou1j7,"This season is a slow build into the merge. It starts picking up pace and going and going and going. It has some legendary moments, characters, and stories. I wish I could spoil a part, but you'll just have to watch to see what happens. ",2
33.0,MvGX,dj7ic5p,"Even though the theme was super lame, it was a surprisingly pleasant modern season, in that it was all gameplay and very little drama or emotion.  These castaways knew it was just a game, and they were all playing it that way.  If strategy is what you came to see, watch this season.",2
33.0,MvGX,dioyx9i,"It's pretty new for a rewatch, but if you're new to Survivor and were getting into strategy heavy seasons, this one is by far the best for newbies into the ""strategic"" game.

Some editing choices are a bit weird, but the end result is very satisfying with one of the best casts in years. I can't think of a single person on this season that couldn't be appreciated in some form, they are all so likeable.

The theme can get a little forced, but once things progress you see the season's atmosphere take more of an intense, but light, turn. And don't let anyone say ""the pre-merge isn't exciting"" because there are plenty of episodes that argue otherwise, I'd only say 1 episode is really bland in this entire season.

Again, if you've just seen this, probably not wise to go back so soon, but if you're new, into likeable people, and love strategy, this season is perfect for you.",2
33.0,MvGX,diozif9,"This seasons is a wow season.  The season starts out slow for the first three episodes. The theme is very prominent is these episodes.Then it starts to pick up a lot. The season has people doing blindside after blindside. You will be on the edge of you chair. There also great characters. You will see people change for the better. You will see heart wrenching moments. You will see moments that go beyond the game. The editors did a great job on this season but certain players get little screen time. Also, this season has no real villain because everyone is very civil even rivals.

33.0,MvGX,dip8ec5,"Stupid gimmick, but after a wobbly start (like the trees in the premiere), it gets on its feet and there's quite a bit of good in the season, and I really like some of the characters. Nothing top tier, but all in the ""really good"" tier. This season really proved to me with the existence of genuine relationships and emotion from some contestants that newbie seasons are better, and that humans actually exist. 

Main problem of the season is that there are some that are focused on making big moves.

**Positives - Some very good characters, human and emotional element is developed, in various ways..., still good strategy with ""big moves"", but also some terrible strategy**

**Negatives - Overawareness, and obsessiveness of resumes and big moves from some. Slow start.**

I'm not really sure what to think of the storylines in this season. Some are weird and awkwardly appearing, but they aren't bad for some reason. This season confuses me at times. I like it more than I think I should, but...idk?",2

33.0,MvGX,dj6d0sb,"Survivor 33 might be my favourite season. I think the casting was amazing. You can tell that everyone came to play. There's none of your typical mindless bikini girls, or big buff alpha jerks. Even the characters that are unlikeable are super fun to dislike. 

With a cast full of super fans, the narrative of the game can sometimes seem a little strategy heavy, but I really do think the players post merge really bring a passion to the game that we don't always get to see. There's character developments, unlikely love/hate friendships, and lively confessionals, with a cast with, in my opinion, numerous potential returnee players. The first two episodes are a little weak, and the forced theme is a little annoying, but at the end of the day, this is a season with great characters who really give it their damnedest. ",1
33.0,MvGX,dior6l6,"A very interesting season to look at since it was the first season made after Second Chance, making the strategy very compelling throughout the post-merge.

This is the first season I think that really has a lot of super fans going out on the island, so some of the characters are very similar in what archetypes they fill, leaving with a little bit more gamebotty talk. Overall though, great season with a satisfying conclusion. ",1

9.0,Vanuatu,dip7tcz,"THIS IS THE BEST SEASON OF SURVIVOR. 

People say the pre-merge is slow, or bad. I don't feel that way about any episode except the premiere. The pre-merge develops the characters that are important later, while not ignoring some of the minor gems that aren't as important. Almost every character has some sort of role at some point in the season. This development sets the stage for the best post-merge. The characters are great (3 of my top 10, and 2 of my top 3 are from Vanuatu), we see all sides of them, and then what I consider the best storyline happens. This season starts good, and just keeps getting better. It's a jump into the new post-AS era, with some cutthroat gameplay as well. 

I used ""best"" a lot there.

**Positives - Constantly getting better, amazing characters, story is told really well (well...I don't think it's hard to tell, but it's still great), almost everyone has a role, a large group of characters are developed. Really good editing. Good enjoyable strategy. Everything I said above**

**Negatives - A season that compares with it hasn't been made since 2009.**

There is a moment where this season just absolutely explodes, and everything leading up to that moment is entirely worth the wait.  This season has a top tier post-merge cast, and one of the most fascinating alliance hierarchy's there has even been on Survivor.

31.0,Cambodia,dioqrfd,"I said elsewhere in this thread that Survivor can be often described as a game show, and your enjoyment of Season 17 (Gabon) is very dependent on whether you love Survivor more for the “game”, or for the “show”. The same concept applies here, but in the opposite direction of Gabon. There are a lot of flaws in the storytelling with storylines that seem to go nowhere, relationships that pop up out of thin air, and very little in the way of humor and personal content outside of a couple of characters. However, the game and strategy are in full force; the players are playing hard, strategic talks and shifting alliances dominate nearly every episode (especially later on), and there are lots of strategic decisions that got people talking and still has them talking over a year later. If that’s your thing, you’ll probably like this season a lot. If it’s not, you probably won’t. ",10
31.0,Cambodia,dioymmd,"This is a very divisive season. I don't like it personally due to many contestants feeling like chess pieces or robots. The editing focuses on strategy and that often causes relationships to pop up of nowhere when they are absolutely needed without knowing where they came from. If you like strategy, it's good. If you want relationships and character development, bad. 

**Positives - Strategy, lots of it, blindsides, strategy, big moves, strategy, good cast, high-levels strategy. Strong pre-merge.**

Something about Cambodia puts it in a different class (as in unique not above all others). From watching the reveal of the vote, to the premiere all the way through. [Heavy Spoilers here is the cast reveal after the fan vote.]

The people playing were desperate to change their story, desperate to get to the end, and willing to do anything. It's fun, but tense. It's biggest flaw is that it was so frenetic that I think it made it hard to edit  in a limited time for episodes. Some players get a really quiet edit.

If you hate feeling confused when the votes are read, this isn't the season for you, but I disagree that it's solely game-botty. One of my favorite moments from this seasons is a hilarious character exposition where one person really does not understand how they're coming across to the audience. 

Don't watch until you're familiar with at least half the cast, though. I don't think you need to know everyone to enjoy a returning season, but be aware that stuff will probably get spoiled from their earlier seasons.",2

Once you’ve done that, prepare yourself for an incredible season. A great theme, fantastic characters throughout, the highest level of strategy in any season ever, perfectly executed twists, a great winner … this season has it all. A little light on character moments, but that’s to be expected from a returnee season.

I can't remember being more excited for a season than watching the S30 finale. Splitting from 2 to 3 tribes was also an interesting twist. This ended up being a flaw (for me, at least), as the season couldn't live up to my wildly unrealistic expectations.

But even disregarding that, this season is a soulless, sloppily edited mess that started in full force the incessant focus on Big Moves that defines Survivor today.  If you're into that, definitely put this one as something to watch soon.  If you're not, as I am, this one is definitely skippable.

It feels like it has a slower start as well, but here it is welcome because it starts storylines for some great characters and some top-tier strategy and gameplay.  I wish I could recommend this one.  Some people consider it flat, but compared to other seasons (like Game Changers), I don't see it.  The editing isn't amazing, but it's not the worst.

But I appreciated the aggressive gameplay and thought it led to some great moments on the show. I wouldn't watch as a first-time viewer, and I wouldn't watch if you don't care at all about strategy.

This is a crude oversimplification.  I love Cagayan, which is an extremely strategy-heavy season, and don't care for Cambodia.

I would contend that ""strategy"" as related to us in bland repetitive confessionals and self-fellation / mutual masturbation at Tribal Council is virtually all there is in Cambodia.  To me it's very nearly like watching actual robots play Survivor; robots who have been programmed to have a single character trait of self-importance, with the rare personality outliers getting banished to the editing shadow realm for their troubles.",13

There are a few episodes in the middle-end that lag a little but still have their charms, and the ending is very electric. It's a great season for storytelling purposes and a lot of the cast has an important place, and like I said a lot feeds into the events that come after- a large, welcome shift from the very episodic way that modern seasons are edited.

If you're into strategy, Marquesas featured major advancements in strategy, especially considering one vote that is one of the most important in Survivor history.

If you're into characters, Marquesas has a fantastic cast, including one of the most iconic characters in Survivor history in their first and best appearance, and one of the most complex characters Survivor has ever had.

4.0,Marquesas,dipo0hi,"Marquesas is a weird season for me. I totally understand why people rate it highly as one of their favorites, and there is a moment on the show that really sets the stage for how Survivor is played today, but there were some really slow parts of the season, and for whatever reason, I didn't like the cast as much as I did for the first three seasons. Probably my biggest issue with the season though is something that I can't really get into without spoiling it, so I will say no more. Overall, a good season and I would recommend watching it, but I don't put it top tier like some people do. It hovers around 20 for me.",2
4.0,Marquesas,dip1dzv,"Feels like all of the castaways are aliens pretending to be humans and survivor is in the middle of its awkward stage. Like the 1980s of survivor. It's also commonly referred to as survivor's loss of innocence, so it's a unique old school season.",1

Amazing camp life scenes and character building, and, for the time, exciting strategic moves. You're not going to find the kind of scheming and masterminding you see in recent seasons, but if you're in it for the survivalist stuff or really seeing the consequences of people making moves, this is a great place to start.",1
4.0,Marquesas,dis6hpv,"Marquesas is often marked as a crossroads season where things went from being about survival and a bit of strategy, to being strategy and a bit of survival. And watching this season immediately after season 3 this change is pretty evident, the discussions of the day in and day out activities are still there but no longer front and center like they were in Africa. Discussions of strategy are now the main attraction and the show has gone from being about survival and the elements to being about interpersonal relationships. 

Having said all this, Marquesas, especially if you are used to new school Survivor, is the slowest of the slow burn seasons. It seems to move along at a snails pace, only hinting at whats to come pre-merge before hitting an absolute fever pitch immediately after the merge, from there onwards it is all consuming. Some interesting things happen this season strategically and it includes some absolutely iconic Survivor moments I can remember watching as a small child. Marquesas was definitely a crossroad for the show, and while some revolutions made in this season seem dated and not too incredible now, it is nowhere near a bad season to watch or start with.

2.0,"Australian
Outback",dios6iq,"**The Australian Outback** is a great follow-up to Borneo, which really captivated America.

This is probably the most watched season in terms of viewers, as well as the closest Survivor got to the popular culture.

AO builds on what Borneo began. The players have all seen Borneo and know what to expect, so tribes are more close-knit and alliances are formed.

It has a good cast, and the pre-merge is entertaining. While the post merge suffers a bit, the finale is good and there is a satisfying Final Tribal Council.

Overall, it isn't the most entertaining season, especially by modern standards, but it's definitely a must watch because of how popular it was and to see how the game evolved.",7
2.0,"Australian

It's probably the most positive season of all time, and I just love it for some reason, probably thanks to the cast.

IMO, this season has the best cast of all time, bar none. It really says something that half of the entire cast has returned for a later season.

Also, this season contains one episode that I think is the best episode of all time, with no competition. It contains my favorite Final 2/3, it contains my favorite player of all time, my favorite location, some of the best developed storylines of all time, etc.

**Positives - Positivity, cast, location, storylines, legendary moments, survival elements**

Are there things to like? Of course: the premerge is fantastic, with some great moments, including one of the most iconic moments in Survivor history (albeit one that has been tarnished by the actions of the contestant at the center of it).  The cast is also good, although it pales in comparison to Borneo's.

But the reason I can't recommend this season as something to watch first is the postmerge.  The game grinds to a halt, and there are really only a couple of things that happen that I find very interesting.

Statistically, this season has the most returning players in relation to the size of the cast (50%) and it is evident why. there is so many great character relationships that you dont really ever see again in future seasons, features one of the coolest locations the show has ever had, has some of the most iconic players ever (3 of them are in the survivor hall of fame), and this season truly shaped the future of the show. some people might not love it and say it's boring, but IMO it's a must watch",2

Most of the cast were recruits in order to fulfill the racial divide casting. As a result, it is filled with boring characters. It doesn't help that it was the first 20 person season, making editing all kinds of uneven.

But for me, it’s hard to appreciate them when most of the people involved in them are so boring and/or forgettable. There are a lot of forgettable characters here, probably more than other other season, and so much of the season is driven by random twists that make it feel much less pure. It has a few people who return and become important later on, but that doesn’t make this season any better, and I’d argue that only one of the four was at their best here; the others don’t really get going personality and entertainment-wise until later, if they ever do.

On top of this, it has a good plot.  Many first-time viewers come out loving this season for it.  Many people from this cast, as such, come back for future seasons.  However, some people find on rewatch that it's actually quite unexciting outside of this plot.  As such, this season is also quite divisive with people placing it all over the map.

The edit is wildly uneven, and production made some egregious miscalculations (and I'm not even talking about the race theme!).

But! Whether you *like* it or not, I think it's an important season to watch if you're interested in the evolution of strategy. This is the last cast to play with the God Idol, but it's also the first cast to really grasp what idols can do.

13.0,Cook Islands,dis6jyx,"Cook Islands is a middle of the road season, I suspect it will be better on re-watch, but the pre-merge tends to be boring while the post-merge is absolutely amazing strategy and excitement wise. Sure, Cook Islands doesn't have the best cast, setting, or use of culture/theme, however it does all of those things adequately enough. One positive would be the fact that the characters who are strong, are incredibly strong. There is an amazing strategic player, one of the best physical players in history, and two who are regularly listed as fan favorites, watching these four interact is a joy and make the first half worth the dragging beginning. 

Oh, another positive, one of the first boots has one of the funniest most embarrassing moments occur during its tribals and so does one of the very last boots, so that may be worth the watch alone.

Also, the gimmick while racist seeming at first, does benefit by adding some much needed diversity to the cast. I get tired of boring white people on Survivor.

13.0,Cook Islands,diouft8,"Just not a good idea. I think a lot of the complaints in the season are indicated not just in the theme but the light shone on it- while diversity is a welcome idea in casting the segregation of these people put unnecessary spotlight on them- the white tribe went in as the ""villains"" and the other three often had eyes on the back of their head as they were the ""Asian-American"" tribe, etc etc. Pressure to represent was high and it leads to the season being drier than its outcome would indicate, as well as a reliance on some twists many consider underhanded that seemed like production trying to rectify their mistakes. It's a can of worms to be sure, and I think it could have been saved had the segregation twist never been implemented (next season Fiji was just as diverse but did not segregate them, and this let other contestants let their hair down- for better or worse).

Think the most bland, milk toast, vanilla person you can imagine, maybe with one trait at most, and then multiply that by anywhere from ten to fifteen. That's the Cook Islands cast.

But even the good characters can't save this season from being painfully boring and lifeless most of the time. There's only one real major story arc this season and your mileage will vary with it depending on how much you enjoy the characters involved. I think it's awful, but some people think it's the best story ever told on the show, so whatever.

I hate this season with a passion, but some people have it in their top five, so watch it and decide for yourself if it's really that bad/good.

It's got some awful and random twists, awful editing, and an all-time horrible cast that's absolutely flooded with forgettable contestants. There is very little reason to recommend this season compared to others - even its abundance of players who would later return isn't a very strong one, if you're not watching every season in order for that reason anyway, because their appearances here don't really contextualize their later returns in any meaningful way anyway; heck, half of them are considered among the most baffling returning player picks ever.

If you do watch this season it does have *some* fun moments and characters along the way, as Survivor generally does, and the central story's not *bad*, but when everything good about S13 can be found elsewhere with way fewer flaws there's pretty much no reason to recommend this over others.",2
13.0,Cook Islands,ditsn22,"There's a lot of unfair, biased hate against this season cuz of the race war theme & the White tribe came out looking like the villains.  Contrary to what many are saying, there were a quite a few standout characters:

* Billy, the didn't last long but his delusional love affair w/ Candice was hilarious

* Cao Boi, the weird shaman type

* JP, the entitled alpha

* Candice & Adam, the power couple

* Jonathan, the two-timing snake

* Parvarti, the flirt

* Ozzy, the best physical player Survivor has ever seen

* Yul, the ""Godfather""

Despite the racial undertones that was the theme of this season, it developed into an **amazing** underdog story.  I fail to get why this story was dismissed by so many haters.  The underdogs even were a diverse group & wasn't composed of players all from one race.  That's a great morality to have as an underlying element.  But, you'll always have your haters.

I loved that there was touching comradery & loyalty in the one of the alliances, seldom developed in this game.  But, you'll always have your haters.

Lastly, the game played by the winner was as honorable as it can get in this game.  Few have been able to replicate this.

Bring on your down votes haters, but I still love this season!!!",1

If you have a young child that wants to start watching, watch this season. A lot of people to root for from beginning to end.

13.0,Cook Islands,diqgbsl,">Most of the cast tries to represent their race well, and so there won't be any potentially uncomfortable moments that come from this.

Your mileage may vary on this. There's one contestant who cracks a lot of jokes about their own race, and the other members of the tribe are uncomfortable with it. I felt like the theme impacted a fair amount of the game play too. No one is super racist, but I would definitely say it's uncomfortable at times.",1
13.0,Cook Islands,dirdxao,"The racial divide itself isn't a problem per se (in fact, it's rather inconsequential). The issue is that in order to cast for the tribes, Survivor turned heavily towards recruits rather than applicants. This filled the cast with a lot of bland people who didn't know the game and/or weren't interested in playing the game. One World has a similar issue with casting. 

That being said, there are several interesting characters. But for the most part, the cast is dead air.  ",1

14.0,Fiji,diosfkq,"Not very popular overrall but I personally think it's underrated. 

In the early game there's a lot of really excellent camp life scenes of the tribe that's much worse off attempting to survive. The general early vote offs are not exciting, but if you enjoy the survival aspect then you can get through it. Once you're halfway that's when it gets really good.

There's a few key players that are very complex and fleshed out, and one of them is up there with the most likable and rootable contestants to ever play. 

There's also another iconic point in the game that I won't say much about out of fear of spoiling it. I'll just say that it will make you think.

Like someone else said, don't watch it first because it's so different from every other season, but after a few I would suggest checking it out.",3
14.0,Fiji,dioulpo,"And here it is! Fiji is dominated by a select few twists that I just think were abysmal and overpowered, with a select few seeming to flail at fixing earlier mistakes. This makes the earlier episodes a bit of a downer, as they are very twist-reliant and this makes a lot of the dynamic bitter and angry. However, after awhile, it suddenly gets very good, shockingly. From about the halfway point until the end the dynamics shift into a more natural us-vs-them and towards the end there is a new dynamic organically introduced that makes the season truly stand out. It's a hell of a divide to be true but once you pass a certain point, it really revs up.",4
14.0,Fiji,dioz6h6,A season of great potential. The twist works in paper but not on the actual show. My biggest problem is that the season has many unlikable contestants that dominate the premerge. The postmerge gets much better though. This season contains one of my most favorite contestants on the show.,4
14.0,Fiji,diphi7n,"Fiji has a very weak, unfair and at best, polarizing cast in it's pre-merge. It's just not very fun to watch at all, and I even enjoy those polarizing characters. The post-merge is where it gets fun, there are characters that are complex, are heroes or villains, and there's pretty high-level strategy for it's time. Late in the season, there's some interesting takes on relationships. It's also a very diverse season, with lots of different types of people, although there's still a ton of duds, the cast is far better than the other season with the racially even casting structure.

**Positives - Really interesting post-merge, development of strategies, complex and unique characters and relationships.**

Despite this, Fiji is another really funny season.  And the whole cast isn't bad.  There are some stars in this cast, and the running plot is great.  Challenges in this season are fantastic, and it has a bit of a cannibal theme.

If not for these moments, I would say Fiji is the worst season of all time. But because of the merge, its right outside my bottom five.",1

Even the characters I like are boring, including the winner, who I respect the hell out of. At least the WA crowd was entertaining.",1
14.0,Fiji,dis6vwu,"Fiji pre-merge in one word: shit. In more words, god it'll make you feel like shit. There is a twist that is absolutely one of the worst in the history of anything. Like M. Night Shyamalan ""The Happening"" bad. This twist puts one tribe in particular in a terrible situation. Understandably the members of this tribe get particularly pissed and they become incredibly dislikable. Then the merge hits and you realize these characters are not terrible because they are frustrated but actually terrible because they just suck.

Fiji post-merge in one word: fuck. In more words, holy fuck this is crazy. In particular you have an episode where an alliance makes an incredible strategic move that is parried by another incredible move that is followed up with yet another amazing move resulting in one of the best Tribals ever. Unfortunately, all of this holy fuck-ery is co-opted in the final hour of the entire season by a few moves, comments, and actions that will leave viewers with a particularly bitter taste in your mouth. In all, Fiji was an incredible strategic showcase featuring powerhouse players sandwiched between two steaming piles of disgusting.

The cast is okay, but it doesn't feel like we get to know that much about them. Only a select few players get decent edits, with one player dominating the screen time.

It is true that the edit focuses heavily on a single player, but their story arc is central to nearly everything that transpires, so it's really hard not to place an emphasis on them. This person is interesting enough to merit the extra attention. The rest of the cast is no slouch either, and it all comes together rather spectacularly. Samoa is equal parts fun, exhilarating, amusing, dark, and unpredictable.",3

This could be a great season if it was edited better. Everything else seems great, the characters, moments, stories, but we just didn't get enough because the editors had to give us this character over and over again.

Do not expect smart gameplay or easy to root for heroes in this season, but if you can deal with that, you'll find a hilarious season with some unique moments.

I love seasons where I can't predict the winner, and this is one of them. It really depends on how you look at what everyone did, and even though it has many flaws, (spoiler, but you'll know exactly what it is), and a useless beginners advantage, as well as a fairly monotone middle between pre-merge and merge, it can really grow on you if you invest yourself in some of the characters that are getting the most focus.

I think one of the most underrated things in this season is that the challenges are AWESOME. Probably the best list of challenges in a season, personally.

However, the big thing this season is that, like Palau, its like a ""imagine if this happened on Survivor"", and it turns into a gigantic subway crash for a good ride. It's just hilarious seeing how some players react to things.

I could say more, but it does have flaws, but I overlook some of them, because it's very underrated in my opinion, and if you give it a chance, it could really get you a hilarious, and fun season.",3

Sure, it has its moments, and some standout ones at that, but for the most part it is rare that it has a good one. Some of its worse ones, while more aptly told, put a damper on the season. A lot of its characters are underedited or very negative- while a good mix is appropriate we often get stifled by the negativity. That and the often lethargic pace really slow it down. ",2

So, I'll just tell you this: I am a ranker on /r/SurvivorRankdownIV, a subreddit where we rank each and every person (and iteration of people) who has been on Survivor. We have cut around 80 people (out of 615) so far, and let me just say that All Stars is getting pounded into the dirt. 9 out of the 18 people in the cast are already gone, and it's expected that at least one more will be in the bottom 100.

It sucks seeing some of your favorite characters from past seasons get so angry and spiteful towards each other. The boot order isn't great, either. That being said, I think this season is a little underrated due to a few stains it has. It's a lot of fun to see all the fan favorites from the early seasons come together. I can only imagine what the excitement must have been like at the time. One player in particular emerges as a superstar, and there's some great gameplay. It's too bad how dark it gets at times. ",1
26.0,Caramoan,diooevv,"Caramoan doesn't get a great reputation among Survivor fans who discuss the show. This is for a variety of reasons.

The editing of this season is horrendous. Characters come and go, some are forced into one role in the pre-merge and a different role in the post merge. Lots of players are just made invisible.

Another common criticism is that the Favorites aren't really favorites, they're just a couple of production darlings and a handful of others that fans weren't exactly clamoring to see. Additionally, the Fans weren't really fans, and it shows in the play.

The winner I didn't spoil at all, but I guess I can't even mention anything about them.

The season also gets a reputation for being dark, but not in a good way. Lots of unnecessary drama from some polarizing characters.

On the positive side though, the post-merge is at least somewhat decent.

But otherwise, it's commonly referred to as a trainwreck. Caramoan gets consistently rated as one of the worst seasons of Survivor. Watch at your own discretion.

Caramoan has much more in common with typical reality TV trash than most Survivor seasons and I cannot recommend watching it with any good conscience.  It to me is the single best exemplar that not *all* Survivor is better than mainstream TV.

The pre-merge is among my least favorite stretch of episodes in Survivor history, being both boring and unpleasant.  The post-merge gets better, by destroying set pre-merge arcs and changing characters to better fit a narrative.

One person in this cast is also fairly polarizing, and while I personally thought they were the only good thing in the season, they get one of the worst things done to them on national television, and don't get me started about the middle of the pre-merge. It's just so hard to watch...",2

The highs are generally artificial and there's a lot of mockery in the season especially when it comes to snaked people- the boots that should be surprising are often telegraphed and edited to be negative towards them like they're idiots for not seeing it coming.

15.0,China,e07mfsb,"**China** is a top-tier season which every fan should watch, and an excellent starting point for newcomers. Returning to the absolute basics, it re-established the norms going forward into the idol era with a closely focused character study.

**Major Theme**: Contrasting personalities and styles of play.

**Pros**: The smaller cast means that every player gets a full story. The gameplay is mostly exciting and the complex, dynamic characters more than carry you through the lulls with their confessionals, rivalries and humour. The endgame is competitive and the final tribal council is easily one of the show’s best. The now long-established idol rules are new here and they do not fail to increase the drama. The location is beautifully showcased in unique challenges and stunning rewards.

**Cons**: There’s one cheesy cliffhanger, but that’s not even an issue if you’re binging. That’s all I can think of – it’s that great.

**Warning**:  Despite seeing the natural beauty of China in B-roll, the tribes live on the muddy shores of a man-made lake. So don’t expect pandas at camp.",37

China's biggest strength, IMO, is that it has a brilliant cast--each of the 16 players are unique and differentiated. Nobody feels like their character is unclear or like they are redundant or unexplored. The game is dynamic enough to hold interest without being so frenetic that it becomes confusing. And the location, my goodness! They incorporate elements of Chinese culture masterfully. There are some spectacular rewards in this season, along with a lot of comedy, some touching moments, some strong strategy, and one of the best takes on the hidden immunity idol on any season before or after.

Every person has a legitimate story in the season, which makes me really have genuine feelings when someone is voted out. Besides the cast, the location is simply the best there has every been on the show. The Chinese landscapes are simply breathtaking, and some of the most memorable rewards in the entire series of the show take place in this season, and through the Chinese culture. The Chinese culture is so well infused into the season, and it just feels so right. From the challenges, to the musical score, to the camps, to the tribal council set, there is a glimpse of Chinese culture every step of the way, and it's so brilliant to watch.

The cast is great. Four of them have come back to play again. Three of my favorite contestants are from this season. The way the contestants act, especially with each other, make it one of the funniest seasons.

Disagree, when I watched China for the first time a few years ago, I had no idea what this one more thing was. I wasn't binging, just one episode a day, and I always watch the recap episodes.

I think the decision was made long before editing, when they planned out the season - in the past they'd had recap episodes and weeks off (forced by the network I believe during S12) which really messed with the momentum of the season and hurt the ratings. It's pretty astonishing that it took so long for the show to realise that they didn't need recaps at all, and now we usually get double episodes on thanksgiving weeks instead.",2
25.0,Philippines,e07mte3,"Philippines is an oasis amidst a desert of shitty seasons. The S22-26 run is Survivor's true Dark Ages, and in the middle of all those predictable, overwrought, disappointing seasons is this throwback to an earlier version of the show.

The characters carry Philippines. It boasts a deep and diverse cast that makes for an entertaining pre- and post-merge. There are villains, anti-heros, golden-haired gods, interesting returnees, hilarious players, a former MLB MVP, a former child TV star, and a sex *fucking* therapist. Fun fact: Tony Vlachos was set to appear on this season as well until his wife gave birth. Imagine that! This cast is already extraordinarily deep. 

Philippines is one of those seasons where most of the best players and characters make the post-merge. That makes for a super-competitive endgame that plays out like the final stages of a March Madness basketball bracket: big-time players go head-to-head in entertaining showdowns that do not disappoint.

Which is all to say that Philippines is top-tier Survivor and belongs in your must-watch list. Personally I'd rank this in the lower half of my top 10.",21
25.0,Philippines,e07nf9a,"**Philippines** is a gem of a season built around an underdog story that puts other seasons’ to shame. From the zany premiere to the thrilling conclusion, the action never lets up and the major players all receive satisfying arcs.

**Major theme**: Overcoming adversity.

**Pros**: This season has pretty much everything - wily heroes, overconfident villains, strategic intrigue, ever-shifting dynamics, ethical quandaries and legitimate suspense that carries through just about every episode.

**Cons**: The season has no real weaknesses, except that the returnees and the unconventional pre-merge prevent it from being a being a perfect first season to show newcomers. And one cast member is difficult to watch if you know too much about them outside of the show.

25.0,Philippines,e08kslw,"Philippines is an interesting season, with the aforementioned captains providing a bridge between new and old school survivor. It also saw the return of 3 tribes which has affected many seasons that proceeded.

It's often highly praised for its multitude of strong characters along with the solid storylines woven throughout, which I largely agree with. It has several heroes, villains and everything in between, with a reasonable degree of drama.

However I feel it to be a tad overrated, due to it being the first half-decent season since the beginning of the dreaded dark ages. It has some interesting strategy both pre-merge and merge but it isn't quite enough for my liking. A major gripe for me was with one particular player who had a lot of power and didn't use that to their advantage which for me kinda stunted the season but others really see them as someone who made the season what it was.

Overall its a strong season which just has a few things holding it back from its full potential, but it's a very nice season to watch whether you're new or more experienced to Survivor. Also this really provided the franchise with what it needed at the time, saving Survivor from potentially so that's definitely a positive. 

Rank: 14/36",6
25.0,Philippines,e090jle,"Philippines is a good season that I think it got really lucky on some of the common archetypes it cast. It has an excellent pre-merge, and maintains it through the post-merge. The returnees are good (as Survivor characters...), some great new characters, but lots of good. There's good strategy on display here, some crazy tribals, unpredictability and all in all, adds up to a solidly good Survivor season. It's one of the few seasons that I have never seen rated poorly.

It was my personal first season, and the amazing storyline in the first four episodes definitely hooked me into continuing to watch Survivor, so since it worked for me, I have to recommend it for you.

* Editing leaves quite a few people behind in favor of the main characters, which brings a less cohesive-feeling cast and other problems (if you pay attention to edit)

* I personally didn't care much for a few of these main characters and was mostly bored through their content. There are also controversial and villainous characters that many people don't like watching.

**Main Theme**: Pirates! Arrrr!

**Pros**: Everything you could possibly expect from Survivor and also from a good pirate yarn – idealistic heroes, unscrupulous villains, plucky underdogs, lies and intrigue, mutinous plots, vendettas, revenge, a twist that kicks everything into even higher gear and a storybook ending to boot.

In terms of characters this season has an embarrassment of riches. Some of the most iconic Survivors first appear this season, to say nothing of the rest of the cast being deep and interesting. There are goofballs and drunks, loudmouths and winers, cowards and heroes, nerds and villains. To the latter, Pearl Islands has the show's all-time best villain, a top 5 all-time character.

The pirate theme is excellently executed, and the players buy in. The challenges are fun and the boot order is unpredictable and enjoyable.

Pear Islands contains one of the show's iconic moments that melted people's minds at the time. It encapsulates what reality TV competitions can be at their best, when people manipulate human emotions. There’s also a twist that might make you spit out whatever you’re drinking at the time.

Three of Survivor's most well known characters come from this season (one iconic hero, one iconic villain, and one iconic anti-hero), along with many other stars that put together a sprawling ensemble cast of great characters.  The storylines and character development are absolutely top notch, and you will be on the edge of your seat at many points in the season.  If I could remove my memory of any single Survivor season just so I could experience it for the first time again, then I would choose this season without a doubt.

The pirate theme makes the challenges and season overall very unique and visually appealing. The editing leads to some surprising Tribal Councils that would have been more predictable in recent seasons where they set up the vote more explicitly. 

That all being said, I do think Pearl Islands is a tad overrated (by that I mean it’s top 10 rather than OMGBESTEVER). The midseason twist feels super contrived and unfair. There are many fun challenges but also a handful that are poorly conceived and/or too easy. Most of the players who go deep are entertaining and/or likeable but not terribly strong strategically. As a result, the boot order is a chaotic mess, which makes for entertaining television, but ultimately comes off a bit amateurish, especially when compared to later seasons. 

But you don’t watch Pearl Islands for amazing strategy. You watch it for the characters. The characters alone, along with the unique theme and unpredictable narrative, make this a fantastic season to start with. If you’re new to Survivor and Pearl Islands doesn’t get you hooked, it’s likely nothing will. ",3

Nothing can prepare you for how wonderfully bizarre this person will be. Tocantins also contains arguably the best bromance in all of Survivor.

The inland setting is unique: a refreshing change from today's endless beach paradises. Tocantins is also a good bridge between old- and new-school Survivor, with Exile Island and minimal idols, all which play out in their own special way here. 

The pre-merge is a cutthroat competition between two evenly matched tribes. The post-merge is a showcase of all the best characters who duke it out in a very entertaining and unpredictable manner. And the final use of Exile Island this season is considered among the all-time great Survivor episodes. One character makes a legendary trip there.

 Tocantins is the season I believe to have the best characters.It has a good, but not great pre-merge, but picks up steam throughout the merge. There's one huge character that I really like, and he's what the season revolves around. He's one of the most unique people you'll ever see is the main character of this season, and his interactions with everyone else is something you'll never see anywhere else. He's a bit out there, oddball, crazy, probably an act? 

I love the conflict that happens in this season, there's some traditional yelling at each other, but the victim in each instant doesn't just die, but they come back. It creates a really good, balanced conflict that helps both characters. This season is also good if you're looking for laughs, there's quite a bit of snark and dry humor. The strategy in this season isn't always in the forefront, but it's always there, and mixes with everything really well.

This is a season I'd recommend to watch early because it's pretty easy to watch and understand, while there's still definite strategy going on, and plenty of great moments to see.

Except for perhaps Pearl Islands, HvV is the most entertaining season, scene-to-scene. There's rarely a dull moment. The pre-merge is bananas, with an all-time rivalry that hinges on some of the most chaotic and famous tribals. The post-merge equals that chaos with its own set of all-time great tribals and strategy. Two of the top 5 tribals happen in this season.

To say this cast is deep is an understatement. This really is a Hall of Fame roster. The strategy is excellent, and so is the entertainment. There's tons of humor, hilarious sniping back and forth, and well-fought challenges. Characters who had relationships in past seasons expand on those relationships in interesting ways.

The one thing keeping newbies from watching HvV, of course, is that it references older seasons. When you start Survivor, treat this season like a bottle of wine. Don't pop it right away; it's not ready. Watch the necesarry seasons before HvV while this one rests in your cellar.

**Pros**: Everything – characters, gameplay, drama, suspense, conflict, mistakes, innovation and importance to the franchise as a whole.

**Cons**: The temptation to skip straight to HvV. Please try to resist – you only get to watch it for the first time once. To fully enjoy that first watch, try to get through most of the returnees’ earlier seasons first (especially 7, 8, 15, 16 and 18).

That said, it's much better when you know the faces beforehand, and it's also not flawless -- while it's still very highly regraded, it does have some issues with some unbalanced editing, with one potential storyline in particular completely swept under the rug in one of the most baffling editing decisions ever. A lot of the people that may be amongst your favorites go out early (but you'll likely be a fan of so many of these people that some of them will go far as well), some of the content can be a bit repetitive/generic at times, and, as with most 20 person seasons, it does feel sort of rushed in a spot or two. So while it's very good, I don't think it's a perfect season that should be something you rush into immediately anyway.

I had already heard all the hype about it and so I came in with high expectations. While watching it I didn't seem *too* invested even though I was really enjoying it. Looking back at it retrospectively I can understand the praise it constantly gets.

The best part about this season is the cast. Five of my all time favorite contestants appear on it and it made me appreciate some contestants I already liked even more.

There are legendary moves that happen that make each episode super exciting. The challenges are great and reference older challenges. It's a great season but since it's a season consisting entirely of returning players it's not a good one to start with. It's a fantastic season and I know I'll watch it again eventually",2

6.0,The Amazon,e07mx4y,"**Amazon** is a wild ride that all Survivor fans tend to enjoy. The first ‘battle of the sexes’ season remains the most memorable thanks to the chaos that ensued when the genders had the chance to reach across the aisle, which was almost unprecedented in the early seasons.

**Main Theme**: Game flexibility - flipping the totem pole.

**Pros**: Great characters (including one who now hosts the major Survivor podcast), dynamic strategies, unpredictable moves and constant suspense. It builds on the first five seasons of play and launches the game into its next era.

**Cons**: Some of the excitement, as great as it is, comes from bad players and obvious mistakes. But only because there are always better players ready to turn things around.

**Warning**: The bravado coming out of same-gender teams leads to some uncomfortable attitudes and sexist remarks, which barely held up at the time. But they diminish as the season goes on and usually end in well-deserved comeuppance.",17
6.0,The Amazon,e083vcx,"Amazon in a lot of ways is kind of like a 90's teen sex comedy. It has some very funny moments, a very cool location, and perhaps most importantly, some strategies employed that revolutionized how Survivor is played. If you are a fan of modern Survivor but find Borneo, AO or Africa a little slow-paced for your liking, Amazon is the early season that will likely deliver the gaming you're craving.

Fair warning: This is an old-ass season that features sex divided tribes. There is a lot of sexist and misogynist ""humor"" and objectification in this season that has aged very, very poorly. For female viewers in particular, brace yourself. ",15

A lot of objectification and sexist stereotypes were portrayed in this ""Gender War"" season, and if you can bring yourself to understand the context, I believe the season is a great watch. 

Aside from the context of society, it is a season with enthralling characters and introducing some survivor legends. The gameplay is very advanced for an old-school season and is the season that launches a more strategic era of Survivor before its time.",3
6.0,The Amazon,e08jtl1,"I LOVE THIS SEASON.  It doesn't seem to get a lot of love nowadays, but I think it's an absolutely hilarious season of television that pretty much resembles a high school drama that plays out on survivor.  Nearly every character on this season can be matched with a well known role from a high school drama, and it plays out so perfectly.  There's also this highly negative vibe to it that I strangely find really enjoyable to watch.  If you're a fan of people bitching about other people behind their backs (which matches up well with the high school drama theme), then you will really enjoy this season.  Beyond that though there's also a ton of development in Survivor strategy that takes place here, and for that it's a season with much variety that can please many fans of the show that have different tastes in what they find enjoyable to watch.  This season is just such a classic.

This is a very entertaining season, full of huge characters, memorable train wrecks, big blindsides, innovative idol play, hilarious moments, competitive challenges, rivalries and betrayals, and meaningful twists. Cagayan is pure entertainment.

S28 contains the best villain in modern Survivor. This player takes 0 shit, slings tons of insults, pisses off so many people, and slashes and burns their way forward like a snarkier, funnier version of Russel Hantz. The endgame in general contains some of the biggest and most memorable characters in modern Survivor.  And yet the pre-merge is just as enjoyable.

Modern Survivor begins with Cagayan. The producers have been trying to capture this unique blend of theme, character, strategy, and chaos ever since. Cagayan is a top 5 season, and among the most important in the show’s history. Watch it.",12
28.0,Cagayan,e07mm4y,"**Cagayan** is consistently named one of Survivor’s best seasons due to its strong cast, relatable characters and frenetic pacing. A full third of the cast has since played again and many more would also be worth returnees.

**Major theme**: Unpredictability.

**Pros**: The main characters are complex and engaging, a joy to watch and always provocative enough that you’ll want to talk to someone about every episode. The brains/brawn/beauty split makes it easy to get to know everyone early on, the other twists add opportunities for stellar gameplay, the conflicts are always entertaining and the strategy expands the limits of what was thought possible on Survivor. 

**Cons**: Some of the strategic turns are complex or never fully explained and idols are a big part of the season. These things aren’t so bad; they just prevent Cagayan from being an ideal first season for someone who wants a feel for the show in its normal form.

**Warning**: Some critical story points (including the winner) are overtly spoiled in many of the later seasons, so try to watch Cagayan before any of the later seasons.",26
28.0,Cagayan,e07mt9n,"Probably my favorite season, it comes after a period in Survivor history where the seasons were riddled with returning players and half and half seasons so it's incredibly refreshing to see a season with all-newbies and it works spectacularly. 

From the very start it's like a roller coaster and there's plenty of great characters and dynamic players who really bounce well of each other in hilarious and exciting ways. I would argue that the premiere, merge and finale's of this season are almost perfect. 

Among the strong cast standouts include genius nuclear engineer J'tia, Garrett a poker player placed on the brains tribe with a body sculpted like Adonis who seems to be a triple threat, volatile erratic cop Tony who has made spy shacks to spy on opponents, chaos Kass an attorney who lives up to her self-proclaimed moniker and Spencer Bledsoe a young superfan who aims to be the evil bastard ruthlessly picking off his opponents with snarky voting confessionals.

The pace really doesn't let up much from start to finish and it's really exhilerating to watch. Not the first season I'd suggest to a newbie but IMO it's the best and is the best season of Survivor ever.",18
28.0,Cagayan,e07r51j,"Cagayan would be a great first season to watch if you’re not trying to go chronologically and want to throw yourself into modern Survivor. It appeals to basically every kind of fan - it’s got exciting strategy for those who like gameplay, and a really fun cast with tons of unique contestants if you’re more into character development and funny moments. There’s a slump in the middle, but it has one of the best premieres/pre-merges ever and picks itself back up perfectly for the endgame.

It also features my favorite contestant of all time, so there's that.",6

It has a great last couple episodes and an incredible finale. One of my favorite seasons.",5

28.0,Cagayan,e08hp3b,"Cagayan is a good season, but I don't think it is aging well AT ALL.  There are several very fun characters in the cast, and I think that the first half of the season is consistently great, with some jaw-dropping moments and unforgettable episodes that all cultivate in a climax for the season that is.... just way too early.  After the first half finishes, the season just takes a total downward spiral that leads into two characters dominating the screentime, and it becomes a CHORE to watch.  I understand that Survivor editing cannot be perfect, but the editing of some of the latter episodes of the season is just downright terrible, and it really hurts the season for me.  It does end on a slightly stronger note, but the season never completely recovers after the first half, and everytime I watch, I get myself hyped up for something that doesn't pay off enough for my liking.  It's a good season to get yourself into modern survivor, but the season is not aging well, and it would not be very high on my list to introduce someone to the series.

So don't let the hype get to you--it's fantastic, for sure, but don't go in expecting to witness the best season of Survivor because then it might disappoint.",2
28.0,Cagayan,e08us3u,"I didn't love Cagayan like most people while it was airing, and I still don't. It has very high highs that people often point out and remember, in the beginning, middle and end, however in between those points, there are obvious and noticeable lulls. 

If you love the fast paced strategy, Cagayan is really good, and it does come with it's share of excellent moments, with some excellent characters, but also quite a few duds, along with long stretches with no moments of note, but as a first season? If you want to get hooked to the show, or hook someone, I think it would work well enough, but I also think it gives a poor interpretation of what most of Survivor is because it is such an unorthodox season.

28.0,Cagayan,e099k5v,"I struggle to think of any way to *not* enjoy this season.  It is absolutely hilarious.

Unlike most themed seasons, Cagayan's BvBvB theme actually improves the season.  Sometimes the tribes fit their names very well.  Sometimes they do the opposite, and you may be left wondering how they got into that tribe in the first place.  But then you're glad that they did, because the mess that is left behind is absolutely glorious to watch.

Cagayan is very heavy strategically, and at times can be a little confusing.  Normally this would be points against in my book, but the crazy drama often supersedes it to the point where it doesn't matter, because you're laughing too hard.  And as a result it is one of only two seasons that I have wanted to rewatch before even finishing the season.

The season also showcases some incredible and unprecedented strategic innovations, thanks to the twists and the game-savvy players.

I’ve made the comparison that it’s Survivor’s version of “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” - many of the main characters are very cartoony, very over-the-top, and spend a lot of time screaming at each other over the most pointless things, and it’s amazing. In the midst of all this chaos, there are a few “straight man” characters as well, and the endgame (filled with a solid mix of the two) features some of the most beloved contestants in Survivor history, including one future Survivor legend. Although it’s renowned mostly for comedy, Panama also has some really impressive strategic moves, and it’s the only season thus far to make me cry (twice!) - and not due to laughter.

**Major theme**:  Playing hard.

**Pros**: Most of the cast members jump off the screen and even the quieter ones get their moment eventually. The story unfolds effortlessly, the challenges are gorgeous, the tribal councils are unpredictable, the gameplay is stunning and the dramatic action almost never lets up for all 55 days, including an all-time great run of post-merge episodes.

**Cons**: The show is still constrained by its episode order, so there are some unnecessary twists the players need to work around. A few of the biggest characters peak too early, but there are always plenty of greats remaining.

**Warning**: Depending on where/how you watch this season, you may see it listed as either ‘Season 2’ or ‘Season 4’ of the Australian version – both are technically correct due to a reboot in 2016, so just look for the one that aired in 2017.",21

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,e08fbha,"Kaoh Rong is a very interesting season.  I will start off by saying that I absolutely love it.  It has an amazing cast, the editing is balanced, the storylines are fun and interesting, the characters are WELL developed with many different layers that make them complex, and the location actually manages to play a role in the season.  What makes the season so unique and interesting, especially within modern survivor, is that it seems to be the last season ever that contains all of the positive qualities that I have mentioned above.  I consider this to be survivor's last truly great season.  Survivor has never been the same since Kaoh Rong has aired, and this is largely to do with the fact that it was filmed before  Survivor: Cambodia, which has given it a more ""old-school"" feeling that no season has had since.  It's just an absolutely phenomenal season, and is my absolute favorite season that has aired since Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains.

RANK: 5/36",13
32.0,Kaôh Rōng,e07mzyv,"**Koah Rong** bucks the trend in its era of Survivor to focus on the players’ stories and struggles, which often interfere with the season’s strategic direction. It also features medical emergencies which either make it more exciting or more disappointing depending on your point of view.

**Major theme**: Suffering.

**Pros**: You’ll get heavily invested in most characters very quickly and go on to enjoy some of the best social manipulation ever seen on the show. The elements play a bigger role than any season since S2. Multiple strong contenders stick around all the way to the finale and most of them return to play again soon afterwards.

**Cons**: The villains are more overtly villainous than usual, so be prepared for bullying and intimidation tactics. The evacuations have a frustrating effect on the game as a whole.

**Warning**: Don’t watch this season first. The toll taken by the elements is abnormally high and the finale is not representative of how most seasons end, in a number of important ways.",28

It has one of the best casts with almost all of them being compelling TV, with balanced editing, good season long storylines and well developed characters, while maintaining our knowledge on where everyone stands. There's many scenes throughout that show emotion, whether about other contestants or family, that makes you feel like you know that person better, and make us actively care if that person is blindsided.

S32 boasts a deep and diverse cast, effective villains, lovable heroes, good challenges, big moves, big twists, blindsides galore, tons of modern-style strategy, and a controversial ending that still has fans debating through current day. There's rarely a dull moment during Kaôh Rōng, between all the drama and competition.

If you're looking for an example of great ""modern"" Survivor, this and Cagayan are the two best, IMO. And one important detail that makes them great is that both have big villains who affect the gameplay. Survivor is always more fun when antagonists stir the pot and create chaos. The story of Kaôh Rōng feels more complete and compelling because we have people to root for and against.

This season belongs on your must-watch list. There's a reason why so many people from it have returned. I'd argue Kaôh Rōng is borderline top 10 overall. It's just plain-old good Survivor.",25

32.0,Kaôh Rōng,e085pxt,"If what you enjoy the most in Survivor is seasons where all the characters are distinct and, at some point, get some focus, development, and storyline, I strongly recommend this season. It's one of Survivor's strongest narratives period, not just in the modern age. The game is an emotional one where the events of earlier rounds of the game have echoing effects that shape the later ones. It's a great showcase of how Survivor forces strategy to collide with personal feelings, and how players navigate those scenarios based on their own individual traits and characteristics.

If you prefer seasons where players are as sportsmanlike as possible, where everyone shakes hands and says ""it's just a game, no worries!"" then I'd recommend putting this season off for a while--the impact of emotion and interpersonal relationships on this season is, IMO, a strength, but I've seen plenty of people find this season somewhat distasteful for those exact reasons.

It's one of the seasons where the conditions and the hardships of actually being on Survivor are really evident and it definitely plays a massive role during the season. This makes for both compelling and frustrating television at times during the season. 

Ultimately while I think the contestants are well drawn the general narrative for the season was a bit straightforward and the season peaks for me like 3 or 4 episodes before the finale and then it just becomes rather bland/boring and uninteresting.

16.0,Micronesia,e07m675,"**Micronesia** exemplifies the things most fans love about Survivor. Thanks to a string of incredible players, incredulous moves and interminable blindsides, it was widely hailed as the shows’ best season to date when it aired, and it is still difficult to disagree today.

**Major Theme**:  The art of the blindside and its place in modern Survivor.

**Pros**: The cast ranks among the best in terms of relatable characters, compelling narrators, strategic thinkers and challenge performers. The blindsides get more and more iconic as the season progresses and even the audience learns a thing or two about the game. Micronesia’s legacy is still building as the majority of the favourites (deservedly) return to play yet again in later seasons.

**Cons**: Many of the fans are treated (and edited) as cannon fodder for the season’s better characters, and some of the momentum is lost in the middle when some players throw in the towel or get forcibly removed from the game.

There are aspects of the early seasons amazing character moments, but at some point it becomes modern, characterized by the underediting of a majority of the post-merge cast. It's a reasonably good cast, with entertaining strategic moments, but at times it relies far too much on the surprise blindside factor. But it also has some iconic moments and well developed storylines. To me, it's a mixture between the flaws of modern Survivor with the positives of older Survivor.

Be warned, this is definitely a slow burn of a season--some people find it to have a slow pre-merge, but it sets up an unrivaled post merge.

I'd also recommend this season to viewers who are looking to see queer women represented on Survivor. The show, for whatever reasons, often fails to represent lesbians/other queer identified women. This season is a welcome anomaly in that respect. ",15
9.0,Vanuatu,e07r4dd,"**Vanuatu** is a slow burn, carefully building up characters and stakes to fully caplitalise on a string of top-tier episodes at the end. It isn’t vital to the history of the show but is a truly enjoyable stop along the way that everyone should get to eventually. It’s also a good season for new viewers eager to learn the basics of how Survivor ought to be played.

**Main Theme**: Working with the enemy.

**Pros**: The players’ positions are well-defined in the beginning, and from early on those at the bottom are willing to do anything to survive. The gender split delivers great drama and the result is one of best long-term stories we've seen. Flawed leaders, blind followers, overeager underdogs, master manipulators and true wild cards all become iconic players.

**Cons**: Some early episodes are incredibly average, including the premiere which was noticeably chopped down from 90 minutes to 60 right before it aired (though episode 2 is one of the all-time greats). There are also no perfect heroes in this particular story – everyone who makes it deep needs to get blood on their hands.

**Warning**: One of the seasons’ women ended up in a relationship with Jeff Probst, which partially explains the awkwardness of the reunion show.",13
9.0,Vanuatu,e08l7i3,"Survivor's best slow-burn style season by far.

Vanuatu is mostly viewed as a mid-tier season by fans.  Not a ton of people are super invested in the season, but I'm actually a huge fan of the season.  I think Vanuatu is amazing, and there's this unforgettable storyline that gets set up early on, and makes its way all the way to the finale, and gets better and better as it goes on.  It's a story that might seem a bit meh at first, since the characters and side-stories need their time to develop, but this season has one of the best climaxes ever with so much mounting tension, and once you reach a certain point you will be in for a wild ride that ultimately leads to what I would consider to be the BEST Final Tribal Council of all time on Survivor.  Vanuatu is a season that pays off if you stick with it, and the characters are SO well fleshed out.  It's also a season that improved more after each successive re-watch.  It's such a great season.  Please give it a chance because it's so worth it.

9.0,Vanuatu,e08ltdo,"Absolutely fantastic season. There are some complaints about the premerge being slow, but I actually think it's much better than people give it credit for, with at least three very memorable exists, some cool stuff with the location and challenges, and fantastic setup to establish the relationships that will be important later. 

What I think makes it really special is that there really isn't a ""hero"", and there isn't really a ""villain"". The season does a great job of presenting both positive and negative qualities of all of the major characters so *you* can really decide who you want to root for or against. Everyone is flawed, but everyone has reasons to root for them, too.

Some fantastic relationships, some funny moments, some interesting strategy, and the runner up is my all time favorite Survivor character. Go watch it.",5
9.0,Vanuatu,e08y6ze,"This is my favourite season. People say the pre-merge is slow, or bad. I don't feel that way about any episode except the premiere. The pre-merge develops the characters that are important later, while not ignoring some of the minor gems that aren't as important. Almost every character has some sort of role at some point in the season. 

This development sets the stage for the best post-merge. The characters are great (3 of my top 10, and 2 of my top 3 are from Vanuatu), we see all sides of them, and then what I consider the best storyline in Survivor history happens. This season starts good, and just keeps getting better. It's a jump into the new post-AS era, with some cutthroat gameplay as well.

I'd certainly recommend this season as a good season to start with, it introduces you to great characters and development, pretty advanced strategic play, and lots of changes in the dynamics between castaways.

Ruthless gameplay is shown off at various points, and the actual culture of Vanuatu comes up a few times, adding a nice little touch.

Some say the pre-merge is dull or slow, but this season is near unrivaled when it comes to setting up it's dominoes so that when they drop the result is beyond worth it. 

It's definitely a more character/narrative oriented season--if your main interest is frenetic gameplay with lots of hard-gaming strategists, this season might not wet your whistle, though it unquestionably has some fantastic players who make some of the most exciting plays in Survivor history.

This season, however, is super unusual due to the inclusion of loved ones. Each tribe has 9 contestants, each with a partner (either a significant others, sibling or parent/child) on the opposing tribe. Format wise, it's not representative of your average season.

**Pros**: The cast includes lovable heroes, surprising villains and plenty of comic relief. The plot shifts when you least expect it. Loved ones pairs produce new strategic quandaries and heighten the interpersonal conflicts. The idols only enhance the drama and the power shifts.

**Cons**: About halfway through the season, much of the cast begins to feel unnecessary to the show. Almost everyone watching live forgave this in hindsight after seeing the finale.

**Warning**: Even though this is a newbie season, the strategy is all based upon the events of the first Blood vs Water season, which included returnees. Reorder your watch list accordingly.",10
29.0,"San Juan
del Sur",e07tw8w,"Looking at rankings on other sites, I have to be honest that I was blown away with how low SJDS is ranked. Consistently in the bottom-half, which I cannot wrap my head around.

A common critique of this season is that the strategy was lacking among a majority of players. Among certain players, I could certainly agree, but the majority of the cast at the merge came ready to play. When you see one alliance outmaneuver another, you might feel ready to throw the towel in, because the conclusion seems obvious from that point on. That's the beauty of SJDS, as when you think everybody is ready to ""stick to the plan"", suddenly the game is turned on its head, leaving you amazed. If for nothing else, the winner's journey this season is a work of art to behold.

Overall the cast here is about average, and some of the players clearly get a ""fodder"" edit. Ironically enough, many of those characters who seem underdeveloped or wasted really come back to shine on Season 31. But the twists and turns of the season, starting with the merge, really make this season a great one. SJDS is definitely a slow burn, but when it reaches a boil it's impossible to turn away from.",8

The pre-merge is very bland in my opinion, it's not bad, but it's just very mediocre. After the merge episode though, things pick up and it becomes a bit more exciting and there are a few very exciting tribals.

In short, I would say this season gets better every episode it passes, even if it  takes a bit for the episodes to really get good. I wouldn't really be rushing to watch this season unless you plan on watching the returnee season following this, and this season has 3 people on that season, so it's basically required watching.

Like other excellent early seasons, Palau boasts a deep cast. The editing this season is among the most balanced ever, allowing you to understand the motivations and personalities of most of the cast. Too bad modern seasons do not take a page from Palau when deciding how much air time to give all the cast.

Palau also contains perhaps the best character arc in all of Survivor. One player undergoes such an interesting, entertaining, and empathetic transformation from beginning to end that this character is commonly ranked in the top 10 all-time among all people who ever played Survivor. The Palau FIC is also easily a top 3 final challenge for both its brutality and the way it played out.

Palau does a great job of reflecting its theme. The editors seamlessly weave in the unique theme of WW2 wreckage. Again, the editing this season has to be considered among the best.

The post-merge has the greatest relationships, and shows how Survivor can take their toll on someone's mind. The post-merge is just so compelling and shows the darker parts of the emotional sides of Survivor, and it's very serious in tone. Not to say there isn't any funny stuff that goes on, but the stuff that you laugh at isn't exactly lighthearted jokes. Once you get to the post-merge, you'll just keep wanting to watch the next episode, it's extremely compelling.

**Major theme**: Redemption.

**Pros**: Stories and moves that often seem standard are infused with new interest and complexity because of the BvW twist, even during the pre-merge. Every member of the cast receives decent focus and most of them are engaging characters right away.

As a season, it's mediocre. The cast is interesting, but overall mediocre. Lot's of them fall around the midpoint of my rankings. There's some good moments, the blood/non-blood connections worked way better than expected. The relationships in this season were interesting to see, the pairs, with other pairs and individually, and are a strength,

Positives - BvW twist, relationships, good strategy, some really big fun moments

Negatives - Characters aren't great

1.0,Borneo,e07mil3,"**Borneo** is the truest social experiment, a group of strangers thrown into a strange game with no precedents and no idea what to make of it. It’s unlike any other season but it’s fascinating television that drew in millions of viewers worldwide. A must-watch for any Survivor fan.

**Major Theme**: The conflict between strategy and integrity, greed and friendship.

**Pros**: Seeing where it all started and experiencing the game before there were alliances. Watching a stellar cast who the show essentially turned into celebrities. 

**Cons**: If you’re looking for strategic complexity, don’t expect to find it here. But all of the basic things that seem predictable in later seasons are complex and iconic here where they are first invented, executed and analysed both strategically and morally.

**Warning**: Try not to come into the season with too many expectations. It’s more fun to pick up the threads of where the show is ultimately headed if you don’t get disappointed by the experimental editing, hosting or storytelling choices that were quickly corrected.",21

1.0,Borneo,e082j1p,"I personally found this season just as compelling on rewatch as I found it when the show first began in 2000. But as you'll see in the responses, not all fans feel that way.

I think it's worth going into this one with realistic expectations--reality tv was a new, emerging genre at the time this was filmed and a game like Survivor had never been played before. If you want the strategy and refined production of modern times, you clearly aren't going to find it here.

I think, however, that every fan of Survivor owes it to themselves to see where it all began at some point, even if you don't make this season your first.

If you have seen some of the later seasons (or if you haven't) and have decided you want to undertake the the whole series, I'd recommend just starting here and going in order, especially for the first 8 seasons (with 8 being All-Stars and a sort of cap-off to the original Survivor era).",7
1.0,Borneo,e08mmj6,"My #1 recommendation on what to watch first...because it's the first season.

It's a fantastic season of Survivor...well, if you can still consider it Survivor because it's so different from anything else. Everything's still rough and unrefined. This is at it's heart, a season based on social interaction, and has lots of charm of being different, it wasn't perfected yet, yet is so perfect in it's own way. 

The earliest strategy was created here, and if you changed one player, I think every other season turns out differently, or doesn't even exist. It's interesting to see how the views were, and how they are now regarding the game. Strategy certainly does not drive the season, the characters do. The conflict between strategy being good and bad is something you'll never see on any other season, as they were all figuring it out. 

And also, the cast is awesome. Each one has their own unique personality, charm and relationship with others. All these different people, most are entertaining in their own way, and it almost feels like it was meant to be, the duds leave early, and the ones that last turn into legends.

Keep in mind that this was the first season, and not everything is perfect, it's still unrefined.

The camp life scenes are more slice-of-life than either relevant or entertaining. You just...see a lot more filler than you do in modern seasons. And that's absolutely some people's thing, and go for it if so!

1.0,Borneo,e08ngsv,"Borneo is the most raw and real season that has ever been produced even 18 years later. Everything else is just adding onto to something that had already been established; here, you are watching the concept for the show being established. 

An absolutely fantastic and diverse set of characters here, and I think that above all else is its biggest selling point. There's a reason it won the hearts of 50+ million people in the year 2000. The contestants include a 23 year old bible thumping dairy farmer, a 72 year old retired Navy SEAL, and everything in between. The people are fun, interesting, and strong narrators, and the show does a fantastic job constructing a story for each and every one of them.

Is it perfect? Nah. The show is very clearly finding its footing at this point -- which is to be expected -- and there's some stuff that was done here that hasn't been again, and sometimes for good reason. Still, an absolutely unique and fascinating viewing experience with some of the most iconic moments in the history of not just Survivor, but in all of television. 

Definitely a must watch for any fan of the show and if you're going to go through and watch every season at some point, the best place to start.",2
1.0,Borneo,e08t0vs,"I watched Borneo for the first time ever as my first ever Survivor season a few months ago.

I was completely blown away.

This is the perfect starting point and the true defining season for what the show would turn out to be. It's best enjoyed knowing as little as possible about what the show would become, because the cast were working it out as they went along too.

Some players are villainous. Some are lovable. Some are clueless. All are memorable. And the finale is explosive and thrilling. I really really recommend Borneo as the ideal place to start, and as a must\-watch to understand how Survivor  became a show about agency and strategy.",2
1.0,Borneo,e09bxvb,"The original Survivor social experiment remains by far the greatest thing the franchise has put out. With no idea which viewers would necessarily tune in, the producers had to cast as wide a net as possible, getting contestants from all walks of life that at once feel like familiar friends and colorful TV characters - that tap into but expand upon familiar cultural archetypes.

To make each episode as impactful as possible, they then had to give more of these contestants focus than we often see nowadays - there are no ""purple"" edits or ""invisible"" contestants. The end result is the best and best-editedbcast in Survivor history, and watching the first experiment unfold and the game be birthed before your eyes is a television experience like no other.",2

17.0,Gabon,e07mv03,"Perfect trainwreck of a season. This is great if you want a season that isn’t so heavily focused on strategy and want to laugh at the sheer randomness of the season. Almost everything goes against regular strategy, and I think most of the characters are pretty enjoyable. ",20
17.0,Gabon,e07n4ph,"**Gabon** is a spectacle. A series of unconventional casting choices, poor decisions and unlucky breaks place most of the power in the hands of players who are not at all strategic, often despite themselves, and hilarity ensues. 

**Major Theme**: Bizzaro Survivor.

**Pros**: The Gabon experience is unlike any other. You’ll find yourself questioning the motivations of everyone on screen (Jeff included) and rooting for characters you would ordinarily hate. The villains are iconic, the heroes are dubious at best, and the ending is suitably chaotic. The landscape is stunningly beautiful in HD and the players directly encounter iconic (and dangerous) animals.

**Cons**: If you like your strategy complex, logical and successful, this maybe isn’t the season for you. If you care more for gameplay than for long-term story arcs, prepare to be infuriated.

**Warning**: I can’t guarantee that you’ll like this season. But love it or hate it (the split is pretty even and there’s no middle ground), everyone ought to behold it at least once.",19
17.0,Gabon,e08565z,"First and foremost--this is probably the most beautiful season of Survivor there is. This season was the perfect time for Survivor to go HD, as the lush coastal jungles of West Africa are among the most breathtaking locations on the planet, let alone on Survivor. The contestants, at multiple points in the season, interact with African wildlife. If you're an animal lover, Gabon will definitely have some stand out moments.

That aside, however, know this season is *polarizing!* Some people consider it a top tier masterpiece, others consider it the single worst season of all time, I'm not even kidding. (Personally, I fucking love it).

If you're looking for high level strategic competence, look elsewhere. If you want to watch Survivor so the best of the best can duke it out, this isn't going to be your season.

If you love blatant insanity, Reality TV crazies, people making irrational and emotional decisions, trainwrecks, and Gilmore Girls, you will probably get a big ol' Gaboner watching this one. ",18

17.0,Gabon,e08q3xc,"Gabon is the definition of a polarizing season. Some people, like myself, absolutely adore it due to the unhinged array of characters within the ensemble cast that just bring nonstop entertainment the entire way through. When I say unhinged, I really mean it, because this cast is batshit insane towards each other, and if you're into petty drama then you will certainly be in for a treat. These people are ruthless and petty to each other the entire way through in order to win that million dollars, and it never gets old. Other great aspects of the season are the GORGEOUS location, extremely unique and fun challenges, and the amount of times that I simply could not stop laughing. There are just so many comedic gold moments here that completely delivered.

If you are a person that loves petty drama like myself then this season will be a goldmine of fun. If you like the cast, then you WILL LOVE the season, I promise.

31.0,Cambodia,e07pttb,"**Cambodia** is a divisive season – some adore it for being the most strategically complex season to date, but others resent it for not fully servicing all of the returning cast.

**Major theme**: Inconsistency. Everything is in flux – alliances, friendships, legacies and the format.

**Pros**: Strong gameplay from a cast who all show up to correct previous mistakes, backstabbing left and right in what they know to be a zero sum game. Strong stories for the major characters. Constant unpredictability each episode. New heights in gameplay, and renewed importance for the basic social game.

**Cons**: Even though everything we do see is enjoyable – the cast all deserve to return – some great players get lost in the edit, and the narrative doesn’t always have time to go back and properly explain moves.

**Warning**: Even though Cambodia sets the tone for later seasons, it majorly spoils earlier ones. If you want a feel for ‘postmodern Survivor’ try S33 instead. Also don’t watch the cast selection clip from the S30 reunion if you don’t want additional spoilers.

**Tip**: If you do watch Cambodia before seasons 1, 2, 7, 12, 15, 18, 19, 25 of 27-30, check out [this minimal spoiler guide](https://redd.it/5qbods) before starting.",12
31.0,Cambodia,e083gxw,"Cambodia is a polarizing season, as it's a season that your enjoyment of will largely depend, IMO, on what you are most interested in getting out of your reality tv. A poster last year said that Survivor is a ""game show"" and that there are fans who care more about the ""game"" and others who care more about the ""show."" Cambodia is definitely in the former.  Fans of strong narratives and episodic character development will likely find this season underwhelming. As the cast is all returning players who have never won, everyone is there to play and there to play *hard,* and therefore the strategy is the overwhelming focus of the season. If your interest is more in seeing dynamic gameplay, you're really going to like this one.

A fair warning--this is SECOND CHANCES! Anyone you see here has, by definition, lost their first season. If you want to watch all seasons and don't want spoilers, you really shouldn't be watching returning player seasons until you've seen the seasons prior. This season does continue some storylines from the contestants first seasons, and you'll probably enjoy it *more* if you've seen the seasons leading up to this one. ",7
31.0,Cambodia,e08przl,"I'm probably the minority on this one, but while Cambodia starts out well enough for the first few episodes, it quickly becomes a way too strategic season with way too little character development. The one character that they do decide to ""develop"" is forced, and the entertaining characters get left to the background, one specific one just doesn't exist. I don't like it personally due to many contestants feeling like chess pieces or robots. The editing focuses on strategy and that often causes relationships to pop up of nowhere when they are absolutely needed without knowing where they came from.

It's also a returnee season, and the essence of modern Survivor, strategy and lacking in character development, so I would not recommend this anywhere near the top of your ""seasons to watch"" list. 

However...it's not like Cambodia is unwatchable by any means. If you love dynamic and constant gameplay and strategy, this is your thing, and there are fun character moments, they are just very infrequent.

Outback",e07mrk5,"**The Australian Outback** fully embodies ‘old school Survivor’, focusing more on the cast, relationships and location than the strategic game.  It was hugely popular when it aired but is not as enjoyable to watch without the nostalgia of having followed it in real time.

**Main Themes**: Heroes, villains, and whether the ‘good guys’ can succeed in a cutthroat strategic game.

**Pros**: The characters. By far the show’s most watched season, a full half of the cast members have returned to play again and for good reason. The location and the challenges it presents is also featured strongly, especially in the later episodes.

**Cons**: The gameplay has high highs and low lows. Parts of the season are predictable and your mileage may vary as to whether the cast, location and overall hero/villain narrative make up for those slower stretches and the extended season length.

**Warning**: Context is vitally important to your experience of this season. Try to watch Borneo first, as the result, aftermath and hype from season one explain many of the decisions in season two even though it is never mentioned explicitly.

Never has a location been so impactful to a season other than *maybe* Africa.  So many entertaining characters and moments.  It's in my top three.

11.0,Guatemala,e08pimk,"Guatemala was the first season that I watched while it was airing, and for that it holds a special place in my heart.  Since first seeing it, I've had chances to re-watch it, and it really is a strong season.  The location is one of the more unique the show has ever seen with gorgeous mayan architecture and landscaping throughout, and the cast plays off of each other very well.  The storylines are strong, the character development is strong, and the are no aspects of the season that I would call poor.  It's just an all around very good season that you will very much enjoy if you go in with an open mind.  It does have 2 returning players from Survivor Palau, so make sure to try and watch that season first.  However it doesn't spoil the winner of Palau, so it won't be too catastrophic if you watch this one first, but still, try not to.

11.0,Guatemala,e08x9fd,"It's an underrated season, and also rather forgotten because it doesn't do anything spectacular. 

The location is fantastic, right from the start it's one of the harder seasons on the castaways. Everything is solid, the casting, the amount of big personalities, interesting moments, conflict, strategy. It's just all stuff that other seasons do better and others do worse. 

It's also good because it's a season with a pretty high floor, you're going to like it, and there really isn't some big reason why you'd dislike it. 

Just watch **Palau** first, it majorly spoils that.

11.0,Guatemala,e0evxd7,"Guatemala is an underrated season. With it being my first season of Survivor, it holds a special place in my heart. The first season to introduce the ""captains"" theme and a mix of returning/new players, watching the preceding season, Palau, is a must to not be spoiled on Palau's storyline, but as well to understand the dynamics of these returning players in Guatemala.

A solid cast, even from the first boot. A great mix of interesting characters, personalities, strategists, etc. The setting of Guatemala is my personal absolute favorite. Tribal council and one of the tribe's camps are located at actual mayan ruins, and the challenges/rewards tie in to the culture very well, as many early seasons once did. 

Unfortunately, this season is somewhat forgotten about due to lack of returning characters, no over\-the\-top events/situations, and this season being somewhat in the midst of the ""old school"" survivor era and the start of the ""idol era"". Overall, a good season to watch!",1

4.0,Marquesas,e084jtm,"Marquesas is *the* single biggest argument for watching the series chronologically. The ~biggest moment~ of this season sells so much better when you've seen Borneo, AO and Africa and how those games panned out. There are a few times in this season where Survivor strategy leaps ahead. There are contestants in this season all playing very different games--some are cutthroat gamers; some are loyal and emotion oriented; and others play cleverly under the radar. 

Beyond that, Marquesas has some really wonderful characters, one of whom will play multiple times again in the future.

This season is one I personally like a lot, but I know it tends to a mixed reception--some people love it, others think of it as very whatever. If you have seen other early seasons and liked them, you'll probably like Marquesas as well. ",14
4.0,Marquesas,e08a6jj,Just a fucking top season. Marquesas is phenomenal to watch and has to be seen for anyone who is truly a fan of the show. Unfortunately newer watchers will probably skip watching it because the show forgot about the season. The characters were really funny. ,5
4.0,Marquesas,e08j1is,"/u/JustJaking talks about this season having slow points, which is true, but I think if you're invested enough in the characters, those slow points will go by just fine. The producers I think made a conscious choice to develop the relationships between a select group, instead of using that time to try to fool the audience about the real boot. I don't believe they had the footage to fool us anyway but that would be immaterial for the modern show. One way or another they would try to fool us. To me it kind of sums up what's so good about this season and old school Survivor in general. Creating the maximum amount of suspense at any given moment should not be the total end goal of the show.

4.0,Marquesas,e07m0nm,"**Marquesas** marks many of the most important strategic shifts in gameplay since the first season and so will always be recommended if you want to learn your Survivor history. On its own, the season is divisive due to some predictable stretches between the shifts.

**Major Theme**: Underdogs.

**Pros**: The overall story of the season is one for the ages. The cast features a number of big standouts including some important future returnees, and some of the first ‘big moves’ in Survivor history. The endgame is easily the most exciting out of all the early seasons.

**Cons**:  The season’s turning points do not always maintain the excitement during other episodes. The season also addresses race and religion which can be off-putting for some, even if others think that it makes for fascinating interpersonal dynamics.

**Warning**: Part of the strategic development this season involves targeting threats earlier than usual, so expect some surprises early on.",10

3.0,Africa,e07nc20,"Out of the first five seasons, **Africa** is probably the most welcoming to viewers familiar with the modern show. It consistently delivers drama, suspense and strategic interest even if that strategy is often simplified or not properly executed.

**Main Theme**: Commitment to allies.

**Pros**: The location, which also impacts the strategic game as tribes live within restricted areas, protected from the wildlife and unable to escape each other’s watch.  The rewards build in cultural experiences that remain unmatched decades later. The cast also includes a large number of heroes and deep conflicts that make it easy to get very invested very quickly. It also includes the first ever twist.

**Cons**: Many of the strategic decisions are a result of personal relationships rather than ideal play, which is a regular part of Survivor but not everyone’s cup of tea. Definitive battle lines can cause some predictability in later episodes. It also isn’t a *necessary* season in the chronology as you don’t strictly need to have seen Africa to understand the S3 players who return in later seasons.

**Warning**: The tiebreaker rule during Africa was past votes. That can be confusing and frustrating to go back to, but less so when you know that the rule was scrapped for the next season.",11

3.0,Africa,e08jflj,"Africa is a solidly good season.  It unfortunately gets swept under the rug when extremely early survivor is discussed since the first 2 seasons were much more popular and successful.  That however, does not mean it is not a good season, because it is a good season.  The location is truly the 17th character of the season, and brings out so many unique aspects to the show that mostly haven't been seen since.  This season also contains my second favorite pre-merge tribe of all time on Survivor, and they are well know as the first ever ""trainwreck"" tribe in the series with a humongous generation gap.  The storylines are strong, the cast is strong, and the first half is very strong.  My issue with this season is that the characters that I had most of my investment in went out towards the middle, and I didn't have much investment left towards the end.  Still though, I really like the season, and there is a lot of good here.

3.0,Africa,e08u41h,"After a bit of a step backwards, Africa is really the true next step strategically from Borneo. It's a very survivalist based season, the elements are certainly a factor, and interactions with locals and the wildlife make for excellent moments. There's quite a bit of conflict caused by the natural divides of people and natural dispositions of various cast members that create discourse that drives a lot of the season, but there's also close friendships. The relationships, positive and negative are a huge reason many of the characters are memorable.

If you're looking for an early season, that's definitely more polished than Borneo, you just might be looking for Africa.

3.0,Africa,e0848t4,"This is the season where the location is often referred to as ""the 17th castaway."" There is no location Survivor will ever go that can match Kenya. It brutalizes the castaways like no setting before or after. If you want to watch the season with some of the *hardest* survival elements, Africa will not fail to engage you.

But beyond just being insanely tough, Kenya is also breathtaking. The players encounter wildlife and local cultures throughout their journey in the cradle of life, and some of these moments are among Survivor's most memorable and touching. There are two rewards in particular I don't think the series could ever outdo almost 20 years later.

In addition, this season has a strong cast with a lot of very memorable characters--heroes to root for, villains to root against, and big personalities to create big moments.

The strategy of this season is largely influenced by an outdated rule that has since been patched, and it's definitely *not* the top billing star for the season, so if your main interest is the strategy and gameplay, Africa probably won't be your favorite. ",2

**Major theme**: Imperfection. All of the players are flawed and it makes for a beautiful finish.

**Pros**: Almost every player gets a compelling story, in addition to the season-long story arcs which are among the most rewarding we’ve ever seen. The characters feel like real people with qualities both praiseworthy and problematic, and as players who each excel in some respects but trip up in others. The shifting dynamics between them and the overall friendly tone of the season really stand out.

**Cons**: The awkward name of the season. And that’s it. There’s no real reason not to watch MvGX as soon as you can get hold of it.

**Warning**: It’s probably a good idea to get to this one in the next six months or so. Just a hunch.",23
33.0,MvGX,e083crp,"I'll be a dissenting voice here and say that *Millennials vs. Gen X* is...thoroughly mediocre through and through, at best. It very much has a feel of a ""kinder, gentler"" season, where almost all of the negativity is lacquered over, and you have people who are just playing a game at the end of the day. The stakes are mostly very low, the editing has places where it is very choppy, and there are quite a few people who go deep into the season that suffer from a very minimal edit.

Firstly, I don't like the cast.  I think many of the characters were annoyingly forced, which lead to me not caring about them as much since they were shoved down my throat so much.  Then, outside of the \~ 6 characters that have any meaning within the story, the other characters are completely shafted and mean basically nothing.  This lead to the season just feeling really empty for me.  In addition, the season was so much strategy all the time that it felt like there wasn't much to get invested in since there was nothing to care about outside of random strategy talk.  And then, the theme, which is easily the most annoying theme there had ever been on the show.  The theme is shoved down our throats in ways that were incredibly cringey, annoying, and tiring.  I don't need to hear for the tenth time that ""X person is a millennial"" because of certain reasons.  The theme was just so annoyingly forced.

I didn't love the cast, and those who I did love went early.  The editing makes the endgame feel confusing and unresolved.  I was bored pretty frequently.

Many of them get a compelling story, or at least are good comic relief/trainwrecks, and there is character development with a focus on the human parts for some characters. 

The pre-swap really sucks, and while the season starts improving throughout, it still has many of the problems of modern Survivor, like ""evolution of the game"", and chesspiece-esque characters that love big moves, but one redeeming part for me is that the editing isn't overediting/underediting anyone significantly, but the edit also has the issue of inconsistent storylines. 

One thing also is that it lacks personal drama, like many modern seasons, almost everyone is aware it's just a game, and that removes a lot of the emotion from it.

MvGX, like many others have said, is a great season to begin with. The characters are well-developed and compelling (for the most part) and there are amazing moments of drama and betrayal. 

Personally, I also appreciate this season for the fact that the winner (and many other characters) are not edited to be one-dimensional, either all good or all bad. You can always have someone to root for among the cast, and despite some vicious blindsides by some players, there are no ""villains"" in the sense of characters you love to hate (or just hate). Showing the winner's mistakes and how they navigate them makes for a much more interesting finish than if you could tell from three episodes out who has it in the bag. 

Great consistent narrative throughout the season for the winner and many of the supporting characters, an extremely likable cast, several of the best tribal councils in the show's history, and amazing strategy by several of the players.

Some really great moments allow for an edit that perfectly balances detailed strategy talks with personal narratives of growth and change.

To me, this season has a great story from various perspectives if you're looking at it enough. Nearly every player gets a moment to shine whether it comes early or late. The pre-merge may seem really dull, but I think there's a lot of underrated moments there. In my opinion, some of the early merge and penultimate episode are the only boring moments.

Second **Warning**: This season is far better the first time you watch it, when you don’t know much about it.

**Major theme**: Secrets.

**Pros**: A stellar cast with plenty of standout characters, many of whom make deep runs and are probably destined to play again soon. Even when the power structures seem locked in the gameplay and the editing make almost every episode feel unpredictable and exciting, even during the controversial final stretch.

**Cons**: The premiere isn’t great, and the otherwise interesting twists in the middle feel undermined by the ending, which has left many online fans calling its legitimacy into question.

How much that moment impacts you will likely determine your thoughts on the season overall. For me, it's still an incredibly enjoyable season, just go in understanding there's a curveball that is coming your way. 

Aside from a rather bland premier and sour finale, I thoroughly enjoyed everything in between. The pre-merge has some excellent and unexpected moments. Some characters pre-merge get a bit short-changed, largely because the post-merge has one of the best casts ever on the show, with a wide range of interesting and compelling characters. The hijinks, betrayals and drama that play out in the post-merge really elevate this season. All of the players came to play this season, and the strategy and gameplay really shine in this portion.

The cast is very hit-or-miss for most people, there are some highly controversial moments that occur, the strategy is admittedly a mess, and the season feels very different and unique considering the time period that it aired in.  I however, LOVE the season.  I think the characters are some of the funnest and most insane we have ever seen on the show.  The way that the cast interacts with one another is absolutely mind blowing at times, and pretty much everything that happens in Nicaragua doesn't happen in any other seasons of Survivor.  For that, it feels oddly different than most other seasons, but for me it just happens to work.  I enjoy the season almost every step of the way, and there is something entertaining happening pretty much every week, along with one WTF/crazy moment happening basically every week.  If the cast just gels with you like it does for me, then it could potentially be a very great season.  It's incredibly unorthodox, but in a good way!

21.0,Nicaragua,e08n0wf,"Nicaragua is one of the best character driven seasons. This is a season with a bunch of unusual and crazy people. It's a thoroughly entertaining season due to how funny it is. And of course, you need some crowd surrogates to see how ridiculous everything is, who are made so much better by trying, but finding it to play with a bunch of unpredictable and highly emotional people. The character interactions are some of the best ever, and there's some sort of unpredictable event or interaction every episode. 

Nicaragua starts well enough (but it's obvious from the start that we have some unusual and crazy people), but at a certain point, the crazy overwhelms the strategists and takes over the game. If strategy is the primary reason you watch Survivor, this is probably not the season for you. it's definitely not the reason why I, or anyone else likes it. 

There is one moment on this season that could be seen as a downer...I mean it obviously sucks but does it negatively affect the season? I wouldn't say so. 

I wouldn't recommend it as a first watch because of how unorthodox it is, but it's definitely a season you should watch at some point for pure entertainment.

14.0,Fiji,e07n41t,"**Survivor: Fiji** is a dark character study with a slow start, a chaotic middle and a strong finish.

It presents an unpredictable field of shifting allegiances post-merge, one of the show’s favourite heroes and an ending so iconic that it was teased during the previous reunion show. It also shows highlights the struggle of players who have been beaten down by the elements and the game. 

**Cons**: The pre-merge is a long, slow grind thanks to an unfair twist that brings out all the negativity in the largely villainous cast. The editing is uneven and the players’ struggles as well as the players themselves are not always enjoyable to watch.

If you get through the pre-merge, the post-merge is where it gets fun, there are characters that are complex, are heroes or villains, and there's pretty high-level strategy for it's time. 

Late in the season, there's some interesting takes on relationships. It's also a very diverse season, with lots of different types of people, although there's still a ton of duds, the cast is far better than the other season with the racially even casting structure.

It's a showing of how ""dark"" can have two meanings. Unpleasant, like the pre-merge, or have deeper meaning and complexities with negative undertones, like the post-merge. Again, bad and good, but the bad isn't that bad, and the good is really good.

14.0,Fiji,e08cdc6,"As many have said, this season starts slow and features an unfair twist at the start.

But after the first four episodes, this season turns on its head. This is the first Fiji season, so there is more attention given to the location than the later themed ones. There's multiple great villains, as well as moments where the line between hero and anti-hero is blurred. The season even manages to highlight the survival aspects of the show that some castaways struggle with, and how these adversities play out in the larger scope of the game. Fiji also marks the first use of the current iteration of the hidden immunity idol, and at this point in the show, it serves its intended purpose. The idol should enhance the social dynamics that comprise the warfare of tribal council, not replace them.

And last but not least, the ending is classic, emotional, and perhaps season-defining in the best way possible. It's tied for my favorite season, in part because a part of the postmerge closely resembles a certain genre of story (which I won't name for spoiler reasons).

Redemption island is in this season which is sort of a bummer but the cast genuinely does react to it in an interesting and compelling way that creates fun scenarios. 

The two returning players are undeniably bizarre choices to pit against each other but it somehow works and the tribes are sort of evenly matched physically so the pre-merge phase really works for me.

**Major theme**: The split between church and Survivor. Religion and ethics feature heavily.

**Pros**:  You will become heavily invested in the fate of a handful of protagonists, including two returnees, an unlucky underdog and an unpredictable wild card. 

**Cons**: It is difficult to care about most of the cast, outside of the protagonists listed above. A cult-like mentality arises around the returnees, and the gameplay is reconfigured in discrete moments but is mostly predictable between them.

Almost everyone in the season has a place somewhere in the narrative and gets time to show off who they are, the season has a few legitimately thrilling tribal councils, plenty of the challenges feel very fresh especially if you've been seeing a lot of modern US Survivor, and the major season long storyline surrounding just a few specific characters is one of the best you'll find.",3
,,e085axj,"While this season isn't as popular as its sequel, I think it's still very good and honestly I like it better than 2017.

I get why people dislike it.  The gameplay isn't all that interesting, especially during the early merge section.  It is unapologetically slow at times.  There are moments where it is clear that production isn't entirely sure what it's doing.

However I think the strong parts of the season massively outweigh its weaknesses.  The season's length allows the relationships between everybody and the storylines these relationships create to grow naturally.  This culminates in the finale, which is probably one of my top 5 episodes of Survivor ever.  It may be a slow burn, but it pays off so incredibly well to the point that all of the previous issues are essentially thrown out the window.

I also think the season is fantastic on a rewatch, as many storylines are built up over many episodes, and the show does a really good job of subtly showing those storylines.",3
,,e0994tl,"My first ever season, remains my favourite to this day.

Apart from the fact that some of my all-time favourite players are in this season and that the finale is the best thing I've ever seen on TV, I also find the season very interesting for how it combines 'modern' gameplay with strategies that haven't been seen since the very first US seasons.  Because some of the cast has never really watched the show, they are very much learning the game in the same way that the cast of Borneo did, but at the same time there are players who are used to big moves and idols and twists - game rules that never met season 1 strategy in the US series.

With that in mind, I think this is a great season to start with if you are new to Survivor, as the strategy isn't so fast-paced as to be totally confusing but not so slow as to be dull.  And if you're a veteran fan, I'd recommend it even more just because it is excellent.

,,e08a0bn,"An absolute delight – it's a very cohesive, entertaining narrative from start to finish with a dynamite cast and balanced editing.  I'd put it in my top ten seasons overall.  It's a breath of fresh air if you ever feel yourself getting tired of US Survivor, and probably one of the seasons that restored my fascination with the show (the other being Kaoh Rong).",3
,,e08plfn,"Lots of episodes, and it gets slightly frustrating at times, but the finale is this wonderful movie that I couldn't look away from, especially the final challenge. It's also a good intro to the Aussie style of the game before you get into the rollercoaster that is AUS 2017.",2
,,e07o0pa,"**Australian Survivor 2016** breaks neatly into three phases. The first intensifies slowly, the second is dull and the third is awesome. You’ll feel each shift as you watch but must decide for yourself whether the ending makes it all worthwhile – IMHO the answer is a resounding yes.

**Major theme**: Never giving up.

**Pros**: The old-school feel of ordinary people forced to work together through overwhelming odds. There’s enough airtime to get to know almost all of the 24 players, stellar long-term storytelling, plus an original, stunning twist and a final tribal council that rivals the best of the US seasons. The longer game means that many pre-merge boots become legends with more airtime than most endgamers in the US show.

**Cons**: It’s the first season for the production team and they’re still finding their feet. Some episodes end without any eliminations, some feel too long or poorly paced, some challenges drag, some twists flame out spectacularly and some people are casting duds who just want to talk about ‘mateship’ on national television. There’s a stretch post-merge that can be hard to get through but thankfully it doesn’t last as long as it feels.

**Warning**: Depending on where/how you watch this season, you may see it listed as either ‘Season 1’ or ‘Season 3’ of the Australian version – just make sure you select ‘2016’. In truth it was a complete reboot following two ‘Survivor’ ‘seasons’ [which we try not to talk about](https://tinyurl.com/ycc8jamx).",4
,,e07nux5,"Though the season doesn't have the rock solid critical acclaim of it's sequel season, I still think this season some really great stuff going for it. There's an overall theme of ""New school vs Old school"" where modern strategists clash with old school honorable warriors, making it feel like a mix of Season 1 era players and Season 33 era players where both sides are vehement on proving their method of gameplay to be justified. It's one of the only seasons where the divide is this strong, and if you miss old school Survivor where ethics came into play, this season is one you won't want to miss.

The first half of the season up to the merge is fantastic, giving you long episodes with tons of character development and gameplay to really make you feel connected to the characters when they leave. The season does slack around it's third quarter, but the episodes are so well produced that it's not to not keep invested. Then it all wraps up with my favorite finale in any season, US or not. There might be moments in the season that frustrate you beyond belief, but trust me, the journey is worth every minute. And AVOID SPOILERS at all costs.",2
,,e07nkex,"I feel like I'm alone on an island with this opinion but I genuinely think that this is the worst season of Survivor I've watched live (and there have been some fairly subpar seasons of Survivor recently). 

The editing is really unbalanced and choppy with excessive focus given to completely banal and benign things like rewards. The start of the merge for my money is probably the worst 5 or 6 episode stretch of Survivor ever where it's insanely predictable. At times the blatant unawareness of some players that runs episodes long is just unbearable and you almost want to gouge your eyes out watching some of these contestants. 

There are also literally episodes where nobody leaves the game (and in some of those nothing happens and there's literally no character development), the episodes themselves are probably too long especially in a season where for long periods there's just not much actively happening to justify the airtime and most of it is utilized really poorly anyways.

It also contains some of the more frustrating elements of modern Survivor with spazzy, stupid twists. Also the host is bad.",1
,,e089huv,[deleted],1
,,e091lu9,"it's really a slog to get through, in part because Australian Survivor has like 24 hour to hour and a half episodes whereas US Survivor only has 14 40 minute episodes, and in part because not much exciting stuff happens.",1

,,e0d54xv,"I like the host, but I’m glad to find another person who agrees. The extra amount of episodes and episode length benefits season 2 because of its erratic gameplay and compelling characters, but in a season like this one where people can’t realize the obvious, it’s painful. It might be my least favorite season ever, because it drags on so much and nothing that great ever really happens. ",2

30.0,Worlds Apart,e07n950,"Most fans view **Worlds Apart** as an overly negative season due to the number of villains and multiple instances of bullying and hypocrisy. Some people feel it is redeemed by the dark humour and the ending, though even this is controversial.

**Major theme**: Whether good can prevail over evil.

**Pros**: You’ll feel strongly about all of the protagonists, even though most of those feelings will not be positive. The heroes certainly have their moments too so on rewatch the darker parts are more bearable and potentially even ironically funny.

**Cons**: At a certain point the negativity seems unrelenting, the characters unexciting and the strategy close to non-existent. There are good moments but they don’t stand out as much.

**Warning**: This is a darker season partially because it touches on difficult real-life issues including bullying, assault, misogyny, sexual abuse and adoption.

**Second Warning**: The end of the reunion jumps ahead to the selection of the next cast. It’s exciting but it also spoils that some 30 past players didn’t win their first seasons. So skip it if you aren’t caught up.",14

Some moments are extremely uncomfortable for the average viewer to sit through, with themes such as domestic abuse and other personal attacks being hurled creating a toxic environment that exudes onto you while watching the season.

The boot order is also very predictable, and some casting gems are lost very early without the chance to leave a good impression. An issue many people hold is that they don't want to give anyone that makes it far the money due to the actions portrayed throughout the season.",3

The cast is memorable. Some for good reasons others for not so good reasons. Either way you will feel something when you see these characters on screen.

The editing seems fairly well balanced. However around the merge it becomes fairly obvious who the winner will be. 

As someone who has a dark sense of humor I can understand why some people find it funny but even I must admit that it goes a bit too far at points.

Overall this season isn't really that bad but it is still in the lower tier for me.",2

There are some terrible moments in this season, and it's filled with drama that I don't find entertaining whatsoever. Nasty behaviour goes throughout the season, and it shows the worst in people.

There's potential you could find the humour entertaining, and I know some people certainly do...but most people don't. It's a season with a terrible moment, yes, but that terrible behaviour kind of persists throughout the entirety of the season rather than being confined to a singular moment. 

It's just a far too dark and negative season for all the wrong reasons to be good and dramatic.

For me, Heroes/Villains, Fans/Favorites, Brains/Brawns/Beauty, and Millennials/Gen X, for example, imply inherent attributes that could impact someone's game and therefore maintain a certain level of relevancy even after tribe swaps and merges. But for other seasons like Worlds Apart and Heroes/Healers/Hustlers the theme is unnatural and forced and therefore irrelevant as the season progresses. 

Also, do you have any thoughts on the relationship between theme relevancy and how you rank seasons? I'm not sure it impacts my thoughts on the game if the cast is entertaining and interesting, but I'm curious to know your thoughts.",1

36.0,Ghost Island,e07q9l9,"**Ghost Island** just wrapped and its legacy is unclear, though I think it will be remembered fondly for its standout characters and surprisingly original gameplay. The beginning and end are both strong, and the lull in the middle makes sense in hindsight.

**Major theme**: Making big moves, and waiting to make big moves.

**Pros**: The players who played well, played really well and are a joy to watch because the final outcome is always in doubt. The pre-merge is one of the best, the final tribal council is incredible, the edit messes with audience expectations and the callbacks to Survivor history are fun for long-time fans, which this season includes the vast majority of the cast.

**Cons**: The storytelling is extremely uneven, focusing on a small group of protagonists rather than giving every player their own story, and more insight is provided into players’ strategies than their backgrounds or relationships. The eponymous island is somewhat disappointing.

**Warning**: The theme involves callbacks to great moments from Survivor’s past, from seasons 2, 15, 16, 25, 26, 28, 32, 33 and 34. Frankly, most of those seasons are better than GI so you should watch them first rather than spoiling their best moments by watching S36.",17
36.0,Ghost Island,e0904b0,"Ghost Island is a season that involves callbacks to a lot of iconic, and not so iconic messups in Survivor history, that massively spoils some huge moments. 

It's also not that good of a season. The season, especially after the merge centres around two specific castaways, with some others getting some, but less content, while the rest get nothing. The pre-merge is filled with the start of good storylines, some rather good characters, but the ending of all of them is disappointing at best. It's doubly disappointing because they give us glimpses of the potential of some of these characters but they all either don't get enough content or have disappointing endings. 

The editing balance of this season is some of the worst in history, as well as there being little tone in the season, record lows according to various tracking done.

There are probably a solid 4 or 5 episodes that you could skip and lose nothing from the narrative. The casting is hit or miss and so is the execution of the twist.

But so what?  The premiere is one of the best premieres ever.  The merge episode is one of the best merge episodes ever.  The finale is one of the best finales ever.  If you like the people that the editors do bother to show, you won't mind the episodes in between.  They're still entertaining.  People still do stupid things.  You still get to say ""they brought *that* back?"" every episode (I'm assuming you like '*that*').  And at the end of every episode, you leave with a good feeling.  That's all that matters in the end.

36.0,Ghost Island,e08gev2,"Don't do it! Has a bland, boring, and just generally bad cast, a weak postmerge, and just very little drama or comedy. The editing is awful too, but I think the producers were working with very little. It's like Survivor forgot it's not just a game show, but a *reality TV* game show. You need *reality TV contestants*, and not just fans who kNoW tHE gAMe but have no business being on television.

It's also structured poorly with the twists doing the opposite of what they were intended to do. The gameplay is not good despite the preponderance of applicants and fans. And even the developed characters are fairly uninteresting.

This is a bottom-tier season and I think the moments that people do like are super overrated. 

Going bold for a second: **I'm genuinely surprised that it hasn't been hidden.** It's a shit-tier season that spoils previous seasons. Recency bias is working wonders. If you haven't enjoyed any of the old school (pre-S19) seasons that you've watched, maybe this one is much better than I'm making it out to be.

In addition, the narrative was choppy, and I’m trying to be generous. Some of the players that went far just weren’t good enough characters to carry a season, and the lopsided edit reflects that. At times the post merge felt like it wasn’t building towards anything, though the ending resolved some of those feelings for me. I think GI is a decent season and I believe it will hold up on the rewatch, but I would avoid this season until one has watched the seasons that are referenced along the way.",2

It has one good episode, and one exciting moment, and the rest of it is terrible. The edit is the worst its ever been. The casting is questionable at best, as this season focused on casting super fans but seems to have foregone any sort of personality to do that. We never get to know anyone except for like 5 people as actual human beings, and we never, ever see any sort of camp life or fun moments happen.

The premerge is almost entirely dominated by one storyline that goes on for way too long, and besides that one storyline, there's pretty much nothing else of interest going on. The postmerge just takes a turn for the worse.

I think the biggest problem is the twist central to the season. It sucks up a ton of screentime despite not being worth that time, and because of it every other aspect of the season is underdeveloped.

The cast is memorable and there were a lot of members pre-merge (and some post merge) that had a lot of potential and I would not be surprised seeing them on a Second Chance ballot.

The editing in this season is really one-sided. Some of the cast members get very little screen time up to the point where it seems unfair. The editing follows a storyline the entire way through so most contestants are pushed off to the side.

5.0,Thailand,e07nbb1,"**Thailand** regularly appears toward the bottom of this list, mostly because it isn’t such a fun season from episode to episode and only one player ever returns to the show. However, it’s an important season to *have* watched as it clearly defines many of the strategic paradigms and plays that soon became Survivor mainstays.

**Main Theme**: Managing expectations and planning ahead.

**Pros**: Parts of Thailand can serve as a Survivor masterclass and much of the gameplay is still discussed today in this respect. The dynamics within each alliance are explored deeply, so every boot feels meaningful. A classic Survivor twist sets the scene for some of the wild things the show will attempt later on.

**Cons**: Many of the cast members are unlikeable, making for a nastier and darker season overall despite some fun moments here and there. Even the better players on the season are not necessarily likable people, so viewers who struggle to separate the two will have a hard time. There are also a few episodes in the second half which should ideally be watched on X1.5 speed.

It can also be quite a slog at times because there are several characters that you just end up not caring about.

Taken on its own, it tells a compelling story, but it is difficult to take it on its own – you’ll need to watch it and decide for yourself whether it is satisfying, disappointing or both.

**Main Theme**: Changing legacies, which motivate players whether or not they were successful on their first attempts.

**Pros**: Every player invited back is an already an enjoyable character and an engaging confessionalist so it’s a joy to watch from the get go. The character arcs are well-crafted and the story feels complete… if you don’t remember previous seasons’ arcs and stories.

**Cons**: It’s the first season that tested relationships and bonds from outside of the game so the betrayals hit harder, leading to some uncomfortable moments – though even these are important lessons for future returnee seasons. 

**Warning**: Don’t start the season expecting that the best of the best will rise to the top – this is an experiment of a different nature. The players who were less successful the first time around know that their best chance at fortune (and also airtime) is to remove the major threats, so the biggest names coming in are all targeted early.

Everything else is horrendously boring and not nearly as tragic or emotional as people sometimes suggest.

Nonetheless, it is a full returnee season that reckons with the legacies of its players and will undoubtedly impact the future direction of Survivor. Don’t rush into it, but definitely do watch it once you are ready.

**Major theme**: Circumstance. Once great and once mediocre players all get dealt different hands this time.

**Pros**: Survivor legends return and the show truly makes the most of them, even the early targets. The swaps and twists keep the game fresh and unpredictable, and those who make it deep overcome tough competition.

**Cons**: Survivor afterthoughts also return, and they know that it is in their best interests to take out the big names. Early focus on those big names means that characters who make deep runs are underdeveloped, and the twists inject lots of luck.

**Warning**: An incident in the middle of the season is about as dark as Survivor can get. The show handles it well and it is sociologically fascinating, but it still stains the season’s image in hindsight.

The main reason for this is...I just don't care anymore. This season is one I'd describe as soulless after the post-merge. The storylines are very episodic, not nearly enough character development, and there's a lot of ""changing the game"" or ""big moves"" talk that is no doubt pushed by the season name. Production also seemed to want to get in on being a ""game changer"", so there were way too many twists. 

Like so many seasons recently, it starts off well. There's some really fun moments in the pre-merge. But all of those suddenly disappear as the characters that made the season good either get voted out or fade into the background...and I'm no longer given a reason to care. 

There's nothing here except a far inferior version of Cambodia. If you want to watch a high strategy with little character development, go for Cambodia. Cambodia started stronger, had more interesting gameplay developments, and it's strategy was just better to watch.

Don't look back at your words as you go. Write, write, write you drunken heart out. Once you've reached the end, click save, and then pass out. ""But Vaca, I haven't edited a word!"" *Good*. 

When you wake up 18 hours later with a blazing hangover, post your Survivor season. It will be shockingly similar to S26.

Caramoan is first-draft drunken fan fiction.

The editing is horrendous. Characters portrayed as strategic threats become passive pawns post-merge. Characters portrayed as bullies magically morph into lovable heroes. Half the cast receives no screen time, including a ""favorite"" who makes the endgame. And the winner is, well, you'll see.

Caramoan has among Survivor's worst editing, worst pre-merge, worst cast, worst winner, worst reunion, and worst returnees. There's tons of awkward, winy, unfun moments, including one from a player whose dangerous mental health should have disqualified them from returning.

**Major theme**: The line between ally and friend is always a key question on Survivor, but is sharpest here.

**Pros**: Caramoan juxtaposes harsh betrayals against successful game outcomes and examines the fallout. Even though it focuses mostly on the strategic game, the major characters receive strong story arcs and a historic triumph stands out in Survivor history.

**Cons**: Many of the returning players fail to deliver compelling television and many of the fans are uninteresting, so the editing is noticeably uneven and leaves multiple story threads unresolved.

But I found there's a lot right with Caramoan. There are some ugly moments from a production angle, but I found the way those moments impacted the castaways and how they dealt with it to be really interesting on a human level. The favorites aren't people anyone wanted back, but I thought they were still interesting. The fans weren't cast for their strategic acumen, but they were at least inoffensive unlike casts from other seasons. And the postmerge is a ton of fun.

People mostly don't like it because they can't get over its flaws (which is understandable) or because they think the drama is ugly, but I think it's compelling in a sociological and human way. After all, isn't that what Survivor is about?

Side note: granted I rewatched this one at 1.5 speed for most of the season, so maybe that's why I enjoyed it. It definitely needs a little doctoring, but you wouldn't throw out a sandwich just because it was a little dry would you? Just slap some mayo on that bizzitch and go to town.",3

I'm not saying this is a good season. Those good fans are not shown by the edit, instead dominated with the most baffling choices ever to return, and cause the entire cast to be viewed poorly, and is reason #1 why no one likes this season.

I'm not recommending this season. If you do watch this season, my recommendation to you is, pay attention to the newbies. It'll be difficult. But it's a vastly better group of people than the returnees. There's a couple of highlights about 2/3rds of the way through the season of some exciting high drama moments, but those are short and far between in this extremely predictable, poorly edited season.

37.0,"David vs.
Goliath",ep806x1,"One of the best seasons.  

1. It offers a gentle introduction to how modern Survivor has been played (splitting votes, blindsiding, flipping, target selections and 'creating-a-resume'), while highlighting some of the elements of older survivor seasons (the physical demand of surviving the island, sickness, food, livelihood)
2. Twists actually worked and caused maximum effect. 
3. A Very, Very strong cast, and many of the characters are very noticeable. A few of them delivered some of the most hilarious moments that you'll ever seen on modern survivor. Hilarity ensues. One-liners. Funny moments. Memes. Soundbites. Funny faces and awkward and wacky character moments. You name it, they have it. Many of these elements then accumulated till the end where Roasting ensues. 
4. In fact, I don't think anyone on the cast is actually unlikable or despicable. While a few of them are salty, It genuinely felt like that we are watching a bunch of new players having fun on an island, playing the game as hard as they can and be graceful when they lost. 
5. A winner that's very satisfying. 
6. The theme is represented very well throughout the season.  

just watch this if you haven't. You are doing a disservice to yourself by not watching this.",25

37.0,"David vs.
Goliath",ep7igkj,"Very solid cast, despite the ridiculous theme. A lot of great characters, and this season almost feels like classic Survivor with a small dose of ""meta"" strategy. Where this season goes well is that idols aren't the only driving force for the story and strategy. Everyone feels important and for the most part nobody is invisible, which is almost impossible to do with a 20 person cast. Small controversy involving a castaway that occurs outside of the season which is really a shame, because this is a fantastic season amongst a cluster of pretty terrible ones.

37.0,"David vs.
Goliath",ep6y4dy,"The pre-merge is great but the post-merge... just bores me so much. There are some great characters there, sure, but it's like at a certain point they completely abandon coherent story telling to turn it into the survivor equivalent of a police procedural. One second a characters invisible, next episode they are the biggest player in the game and a deciding factor and the important person last episode disappears, blah blah blah. I still do like my season but this is certainly a (very noticeable) flaw.

However I will say with the current meta of survivor, this is probably the best a modern season is going to get, so if you want to job into new seasons right away, i'd say go for it.

Still, this does prevent the season from fully living up to its potential, which is why it'll only ever be a very good season to me, instead of a fantastic one.

It's late enough in the show that it's shot in HD (underrated in getting new people hooked) and contains all of the hallmarks of modern Survivor, but early enough that the story isn't overrun by the meta-development and self-references that plague super recent seasons. Its returning players have a logic to their returns and enhance the season without completely spoiling previous ones (moments are spoiled; whole seasons are not). Characters embody most, if not all, of the major archetypes in a good story, but simultaneously there's tons of room for charcter development and change throughout the season. The pre-merge and post-merge contain distinct but equally entertaining arcs. The first few episodes are gripping but also hilarious, and there is no real lull at any point because the cast is so engaging and memorable. You should absolutely watch this season--it's a real treat and showcases Survivor at its absolute best.",44

The strategies are OK, the elements (challenges, sets) are fine, and the show is not as twist-heavy and reference-heavy like some of the newer shows. You don't really need to worry about the returnees - while it does influence some decisions of the players, the effects of their histories are usually explained quite clearly. 

Philippines's strength is that it tells a great story about underdogs. While not every underdog in Philippines are likable, some of them are very rootable and some of them are iconic. 

'self awareness', or the lack of, is another main theme of the season. You'll see players struggle to find his or her own voice and their own playing styles, while some others think they know it all, only to be seen as delusional and being mocked at. In Fact, you should find this theme enters as soon as episode 1.

Top to bottom China has the strongest cast ever. Everyone plays a role and serves their purpose in the narrative beautifully. Within the cast, there are many Survivor legends who have returned to play in a few other seasons. 


Also I want to say that the challenges are unique and culturally relevant and I like the winner a lot but would’ve preferred either one of the other two in the F3 winning.


All in all, this is an incredible season. China sits at 2/42 for me.",6

Unlike the modern seasons, there aren't a million advantages to distract from character developments and alliances and strategy. 1/38.",1
15.0,China,esb6og5,"In my opinion, a little bit overrated but I can understand why. This is a great season that combines relatively modern survivor strategy (at the time it was one of the most strategic seasons ever) with some old school elements. it has great characters, some are in the top tier of many people and without a doubt some legends were born here. The location is one of the best and I personally loved the main theme, and how it played. We kinda learned about Chinese culture and the way it's play along the season is excelent. The Art of Chinese war is by far one of the best themes ever.

 In my opinion, this is the perfect season to start with, since combines perfectly as I said, old school and new school

If you want zany characters, this season feels closer to the Real World or some other reality TV shows than many others. The drama is quite common and almost always petty. One player subtly dominates strategy, while the rest mostly just engage in silly squabbles of varying intensity. Whether that squabbling with a side of challenges sounds good to you really determines whether you should watch this season.",2

The epic scale of it is set in the very first episode, and game play is enjoyable throughout even if it were just a season of new players. H v V is commonly thought of as the best season of Survivor ever, and I'd hate to see people miss out on it just because they don't want to commit to watching hundreds of hours of TV in preparation.

**Season 8** is an all star season, featuring returning players from the first 7 seasons. If you do not enjoy watching the slow pace of the early seasons, you could skip this one, but 4 of the players in Heroes vs Villains were also in season 8.

*Season 11* is weird, Heroes vs Villains features a player that was on both season 10 and 11, but the players placement in 11 is never mentioned, but watching this season first will definitely affect the way you watch season 11.

**Season 16** is a fans vs favorite season, and is a must-watch before this one. Unfortunately for first-time viewers it features returning players from seasons 7, 9, 13, 14 and 15. Four players in Heroes vs Villains were also in this season, including the winner.

If you know their lore and how well some of the players did the first time, you'll be surprised (in a lot of ways) at how  they performed this time, solidifying their positions as survivor 'legends' inside the community. Considered how much groundbreaking strategies we can seen from this season, there are quite a lot of character moments and hilarious scenes. The edit leans slightly towards a few players pre-merge, but it's overall very very balanced, with a very satisfying ending.

Unlike the majority opinion, even if you are not familiar and you didn't watched every past seasons(like, say, if you haven't watch s19 or you are not that familiar with s2), you'll still enjoy a ton about what they do.

The pre merge is without a doubt one of the best, and although the merge is a pagonging, it is still fun. Plus it has one of, if not the, most iconic ending ever.

A problem of some returning player seasons is that you feel that the ""nobodys"" or the lesser knoen people tend to go far in the game and the legends tend to be eliminated really early. In this case, it didn't happen, mainly because there wasn't any WTF choice in the cast. I mean, yeah, there were people with big targets, but everyone was relatively equal

A big problem? Is too phocused on one person, and sometimes it makes you angry, since s lot of really iconic moments(such as the most iconic feud of the first 20 seasons getting along with each other and actually becoming friends) were left out.

- An incredibly diverse cast who all have very strong narratives and arcs over the course of the season

- Blood Vs Water always adds more emotions and drama for the characters to deal with and the audience to react to. 

- Incredible gameplay from quite a few members of the cast.

- A slow pace at certain points in the season

- If you’re new to survivor, you should start with another season without the Blood vs. Water dynamic

It has one of the best storylines possible, and at certain point when everything seemed clear and that one person would take victory, it gets more unpredictable with more and more blindsides.  ITS ñronably one of the best storylines ever, and one of the best edited seasons. 

However, that doesn't mean that the moves have more phocus than the cast, this is also a character driven season, where the cast is GOLD, except of maybe 2 castaways. And the winner has one of the best and satisfying arcs ever.

There are some fun characters but there are quite of few characters that I find grating, and not in an entertaining way. It's a trainwreck season like Gabon, but I preferred Gabon's cast and overall theme/locale, so I would rather watch Gabon than SJDS. That said, the post-merge is really strong and makes up for a pretty underwhelming pre-merge, and this is still a good season that I would recommend. There are just alot of other seasons that I personally prefer over this one.

28.0,Cagayan,ep6ubsk,Great season. People say you shouldn’t start with this season but I think you absolutely should. It’s one of the best new school seasons but doesn’t suffer from some of the other advantage issues that the other new school seasons have. I think this one definitely should be in consideration for the first season you watch because of the cast and the editing.,14

The premiere is amazing, wild shit happens almost nonstop for 7-8 episodes in a row, and the main characters are unique and interesting - there's someone for everyone. It's not perfect (a few mid-late episodes kind of drag) but it's a pretty great primer to show what modern Survivor's all about.",5
28.0,Cagayan,ep86e7j,"this is universally considered one of the GOATS in Survivor history for a good reason. it's one you definitely cant miss and basically defined and kickstarted the modern era of Survivor.

the thing i love about Cagayan is that not only is the cast really solid with a lot of unique players, the boot order really ended with the most entertaining and deserving players in the end and legitimately every single player there was actively trying to play the game. some seasons suffer due to some casting duds but Cagayan seriously was one of, if not the most competitive seasons in the shows history.

personally i love character driven seasons more so than strategy driven ones and at times i do feel like Cagayan suffered from not developing actual narratives for a lot of the merge players, which in my opinion really only leaves you with 2 or 3 people worth rooting for. with that said i have it at **14/38** but it still earns an upvote for me as i strongly encourage everyone to watch this season at some point or another",5

2. Some of the premerge boots are not that memorable, quite a lot of the scenes that comes from a certain tribe and some other players are absolute gold. The theme also comes into play here. 
3. The postmerge begins with one of my favorite episode of survivor. It has got a lot of great lines, an explosive tribal council that's very exciting, and one central character amidst in all the chaos that contributed to quite a surprising result.
4. Post merge follows with a few episodes that are relatively slower paced, but the strategies and character moments are still there. We get to see the erratic side from a certain player and an underdog story starts developing. 
5. The endgame picks up the paces again. Big arguments and drama ensues. The juries are bitter and feeling betrayed, but understandably so. The results is very surprising.

It's an adrenaline rush of non-stop action and excitement. There are a few editing issues, but they're hardly noticeable when you're having so much fun. Great season. This is modern Survivor done right.  
**Season ranking: 5/38**",2
28.0,Cagayan,ep7i58t,"This season is incredible fun, but it's basically an one-person-show. If you can't stand this person, you may be in trouble. Most viewers love this person, though. Most PLAYERS apparently loved this person in the game as well - they certainly played to the best of their abilities to ensure this person's win .

In other words, if you're looking for a competitive season, this is NOT it. 1 player plays at a way higher level than 3 other players, and those 3 play at a way higher level than the other 14! The edit, accurately reflecting all that, is one of the most unbalanced in the show's history. 

But if you want to see a winner's journey that will probably never be repeated on Survivor, you can't afford to miss this.",2
28.0,Cagayan,epbz3tf,"If you hate what present day Survivor has become, you can blame this season. By itself, it is an upper tier season, however, because of how well it was received, I feel the producers have been trying to artificially replicate the excitement and balls to the wall strategy this season had. The addition of advantages and the over abundance of idols is the producers trying to catch the exciting strategic play that this season had in spades. The only problem is that in this season it happened organically, whereas others since have just felt forced. 

Cagayan, in my opinion, is the beginning of the “new school era” Survivor. The pace is frantic, and the idea of alliances being constantly shifted about and contestants working with and without each other really did kick off with this season. I know previous season had blindsides and backstabbing, but this season truly made it seem like it was just an expected part of the game and not a huge betrayal.",2
28.0,Cagayan,ep8wgay,"A pretty mediocre season overall, and a very bad one to put early. Very misrepresentative of the show in general and the slanted, repetitive focus on a couple contestants makes most of the post-merge an absolute slog.

28.0,Cagayan,ep7i50n,"First, I want to say that this season is a relatively good one.

The cast is one of the best in a newbie season, there is always something going on that's interesting throughout the season, and it's volatile in personality and gameplay. Having the Brain vs Beauty vs Brawn twist also really works out. There are a few issues with the narration, since a select few will get sole focus, and it causes the overall narrative to be more predictable and less interesting than intended.",1

Gameplay: The game has some strategy, but is mostly socially driven. The (comparably) small number of twists mostly influence said social play rather than subvert it.  

Cast: Top tier. *Four* of them could be reasonably considered ""legends"". With a couple exceptions, the cast gets along and is pretty easy going.

Setting: Alongside China and Gabon (and perhaps Borneo for the island novelty back in 2000), it's in contention for the best setting ever. The Brazilian highlands are gorgeous.",4

,,ep7uua7,"This season has it all. A unique and lovable cast, great strategy, and a unpredictable boot order, the season over shines many of the US greats, and it’s a great season for a newbie. However, the late season, can prove to be quite underwhelming depending on who you prefer.",4

,,epj931d,"Australian Survivor redeems itself with 26 of the best episodes of anything I have ever watched. The characters are top notch, probably the best cast in any version. No matter what type of player you prefer, they are here. Charismatic pot stirrers, emotional older players, UTRs, Challenge beasts, Growth arcs, heroes, superfans, this cast has it all. Everyone is playing at the top level. The challenges are beautiful and the franchise’s best. There’s some great story arcs in there as well. The music and cinematography are wonderful. Season 1 has, in my opinion, the worst premerge in history, this one has the best. There’s some truly shocking blindsides that are still memorable to this day. There is, unfortunately, one thing, that knocks this season from S-tier, down to A+: **Twists**. While the twists here don’t ruin the season, it definitely succeeds in spite of them, the twists leave a poor taste in the mouth as many are unfair and ruin great moments. Don’t get me wrong,though. This is a truly incredible season that highlights everything wonderful about Survivor. In my opinion, it’s #3, but it could have been #1 if not for some unfortunate production choices.
Grade: **A+**",3

,,ex0r6u1,"Great season, I think the AUS format with 26 longer episodes is overall an improvement, but it does feel like some stuff gets dragged out. The non-elimination episodes (not really a spoiler, 24 castaways and 26 episodes) are impactful but not necessarily worth an entire episode. I just feel like the pace is a bit too slow overall, and a happy medium between rushed American Survivor and slow Australian Survivor would be perfect.",1

It utilizes the Redemption Island twist better than any other season, and the main theme of the season gives more development to the cast. Speaking of the cast, it's....... an odd group of people put together. The returning players are very random, and a lot of their loved ones would never be cast in a normal season, but despite everything..... it works. Everything kind of comes together in a great fashion, though it's overall pretty mediocre.",9

This season is just the opposite, having one of, if not the best edited season outside of Borneo. Tons of character development, you actually get to know the castaways and you see more the survival aspect of the game. It has a really complex and good narrative. Also, it's everything but predictable. Every episode is almost a blindside and you really see good strategy in the cast.

16.0,Micronesia,ep6vumd,"Micronesia is low key one of the most important seasons in Survivor history. It did a far better job than All-Stars in taking returning players and turning some of them into bona fide legends. This really sets the trajectory for future Survivor; returning players became much more common once producers saw that returning players didn't necessarily always lead to bitterness and could instead utilize the show's own history to make the season feel even more epic. 

You should watch it because it's one of the best seasons to combine importance to the show with being utterly entertaining and watchable. The cast of characters involved gets an A+ from me, as they range from wacky to brilliant and sometimes both, and watching the smartest players learn to harness the unique vulnerabilities of some of the other players culminates in a few of the most widely cited, shocking, and beloved moments in the history of Survivor. Ever.",30
16.0,Micronesia,ep6u9ms,"*Micronesia* is a high-octane season with a lot of blindsides and strategy, though with some character moments and drama all the same.

I consider this a top-tier season overall, but it also has returning players, so I'd recommend watching those players prior seasons before this one.",5
16.0,Micronesia,epaw301,"A terrific season, and one that changed the game forever. The season starts a little slow but by the time the post-merge hits it delivers a run of episodes that are perhaps the greatest ever, with a legendary run of tribal councils.

If there is any season that I believe is underrated by the casual fanbase, this one is #1 in that department. The reason this season this season didn't receive as much attention was that 1) Probst undersold it for reasons that you will have to look up after finishing the season and 2) it came right after All-Stars, which is a tough act to follow. But because it came after All-Stars, it kind of resets the series, so it would be one of the top suggestions by me for someone who hasn't watched the show before.

1.0,Borneo,ep8vpe0,"The original Survivor social experiment remains by far the greatest thing the franchise has put out. With no idea which viewers would necessarily tune in, the producers had to cast as wide a net as possible, getting contestants from all walks of life that feel at once like familiar friends and colorful TV characters - that tap into but expand upon familiar cultural archetypes.

To make each episode as impactful as possible, they then had to give more of these contestants focus than we often see nowadays - there are no ""purple"" edits or ""invisible"" contestants. The end result is the best and best-edited cast in Survivor history, and watching the first experiment unfold and the game be birthed before your eyes is a television experience like no other.

This was where it all began, and while it may not be in HD, while it clearly has some early installment weirdness, and while it was more focused on the survival elements than later seasons, it also is gripping television and full of amazing characters, great storytelling, and is just an amazing watch. 

Remember, when this show came out, people thought that people might actually die playing Survivor. Nothing like this had ever been done. There is a reason this became the biggest show on TV at the time. Go into it with a little context, and it will absolutely be worth the watch.",7

1.0,Borneo,epmotyg,"A flat-out masterpiece. The first season, the absolute original where it all started. Of course this will always be my recommendation to start with. It is a masterpiece in reality-television storytelling, with extremely complex characters and story arcs; all with satisfying conclusions. It is the one season that truly feels like a ""social experiment"" which Survivor is at it's core. No stupid twists. Just 16 Americans from different walks of life being put onto an island and they have to vote each other off. It's as amazing as the premise sounds. I can't gush over this season enough - on some days I rank this season as my favourite, just because it is so epic and unique and otherworldly. But it is very different from other seasons so it feels kind of separated from the rest of the show. But still, this is a must-watch. Anyone looking for a ""lord of the flies"" but with adults should watch this.

3/38",3
1.0,Borneo,ep7hd6q,"The OG season! In my opinion, every Survivor fan should watch this season, I mean, this is where Survivor started. It also boasts one of the best newbie casts, even to this day. Every single cast member stands out in their own unique way, something you cannot say about a lot of the other seasons later.

However, if you are used to the modern, fast-paced Survivor, you could find this season to be a bit slow at times. There isn't as much strategy discussion as there is on today's seasons, and you might find certain characters to be frustrating at times. However, all in all, it's a historic season, and one you should definitely check out.

1.0,Borneo,epayvbe,"This is really the one to start with. Borneo is slow but gets better and better and better up until one of the greatest finales in the show's history. Best viewed when knowing nothing about Survivor at all, so you can see the foundations for the game being built by the players.

1.0,Borneo,eplej52,"I am horrendously biased as I started with this season and just watched all the way through in 18 months, but... I really think for the truest *Survivor* experience, start with this season and make your way through them. Doing it out of order means that context for certain seasons will be lost and storylines in certain seasons will have less impact. I admit that if you're not intending to watch them all then watching them in order may not be the way to go as you'll miss out on some decent later seasons.

However, the thing is, if you watch this season later, it'll lose it's impact and you'll find yourself bored by the strategy if you've seen a highly-intense previous season. I truly think that, even if you're not intending to go in order, you should still start with this one; you can really feel the development of the strategy, as well as a story that is never really bettered. The finale is still one of my favourite episodes of *Survivor* and I don't think it would have been if I'd seen later seasons; it wouldn't be so wonderfully raw and organic.

Even if you don't want to go in order, please start with this season - you won't regret it.",2
1.0,Borneo,ep6wled,"This is a fantastic season to start with The characters are developed well. The gameplay is slow, but it's interesting to see a bunch of different strategies.

Anyways, it's one of the best in my ranking. You see how 16 strangers live together to create a new society, how they interact, how big of a social experiment it is. And you actually see them surviving (something that we don't see today, although this last 2 seasons featured a lot of camplife compared to, idk, season 33). It has their low moments, however the cast is one of the Best and that really helps you to not get bored.

It is fascinating and endearing in the sense that you are watching players, editors, and Jeff Probst figure out how to survivor for the first time. I view this season as an artifact of survivor past and as a history lesson of how one of the greatest reality TV shows came to be. You should keep that in mind when deciding whether to watch this season or not.",1

Something so funny and wacky and off and it kinda worked. You can even say this is Survivor's 'The Room'. 

It's very weird, because it's unlike anything survivor has done and had done, and I doubt survivor would ever have a season as weird as this. It doesn't revolutionized how survivor's been played. In fact, you could said that this season actually undo the revolution! 

Ultimately, Like any fan fiction, you should watch the original before you start looking at the doujinshis or the fanfictions. So go watch some older seasons. Comeback, Enjoy the cluster fuck.",5

17.0,Gabon,ep8yvgk,"To be honest, I don't get the ""trainwreck"" or ""clusterfuck"" label for this season in the slightest. Nicaragua and Panama, sure, but here I don't get it at all. I think this is a pretty straightforward season in a lot of ways that'd be very appealing to a first-time viewer in particular, a solid midpoint of old-school character vibes with a light, accessible, but present focus on modern twists and strategy, and a pretty satisfying story overall. Along the way it has a ton of great characters and a lot of comedy, but I don't see it as some weird, bizarre ""freak show"" either -- just a character-driven season.

I think it makes more sense, has more heart, and is better paced than it gets credit for and if one isn't gonna start with the original, this is the next-best starting point. At any rate it's a very entertaining season I'd watch basically as early as possible.",3

17.0,Gabon,ep74qtp,"Wouldn't watch this season unless you enjoy the more dramatic parts of Survivor. Negativity abounds, and while the chaos is attractive to some people, it makes for a very particular kind of season--there are a lot of shouting matches, some truly cruel things are said, and the theme of the season is ultimately ""who do I hate the least?"" It stands out in Survivor history because it's so chaotic, but that chaos comes from a lot of people just fighting a lot, not any kind of strategic wonkiness. If you want the petty drama, come watch Gabon. If you watch for other reasons, probably best to stay away.",4

The characters are great and funny. You don't know who you have to root, because the ""villains"" can be more rooteable than the Heroes this season. Has a lot of drama. But it's not those dramas you see In some series or even in some recent seasons, it's not a ""fake drama"", you can easily see that the drama of the season is 100% real, mainly because the characters are crszy.

\-Twists are engaging without dominating the season, injecting some randomness for players to adjust to without jumping the shark and unfairly shaping the ultimate result. As a result, you get the highs of the advantage era of Survivor without the lows that can stem from putting so many variables into play.

\-The characters in this cast have clear motivations and are decently explained, even if some players' motivations are sometimes silly or frustrating. The season's story makes sense, and feels like it's told fairly. 

\-There's a fun, positive vibe to the season, but that's paired with a few very notable touching and deeply poignant emotional scenes.

33.0,MvGX,ephpfwx,"For some reasons, this is a polarizing season, but if you're a new Survivor fan trying to catch up, this should be one of the first seasons you watch. Watching this season requires no prior Survivor knowledge. There are no returning players, and there are no spoilers of prior seasons. I'm not going to lie, the cast has some forgettable characters, but the cast also has more memorable players. The season's theme is admittedly cheesy and the casting seems to have been colored by it. Almost everyone is either in their early 20s or 40s, not much in between. By the merge, however, the theme is basically never mentioned, so if the theme makes you cringe, hold on. The story is great and twists are exciting. I would argue this season has one of the best pre-merges of any season. The post-merge starts to temper off near the end, but it is still high-quality Survivor. In any event, by the end you're so invested in the players you are hooked, you will want to see the next episode, and you will be sad to see it end.

Pros:

+great and memorable cast

+great twists and exciting tribals

+best pre-merge of any season

+great for new fans


Cons:

-cheesy theme

-post-merge game starts to stall near the very end of the season",2

- Some of the most intense and iconic tribal councils of the show’s history

- Many characters fall victim to underdeveloped story-telling 

- You May be able to guess the winner fairly early on by the content they receive

But the truth is that Palau is so unique and out there as far as survivor seasons go, that we'll never get another season like it. And that's just what makes it amazing.

Would highly recommend this season for like your 5th or 6th season to watch, as A) It may get your expectations for survivor too high, and B) gotta be able to appreciate the uniqueness.

10.0,Palau,ep6t0rn,"This is easily my favorite season of all time.  I just love it so much.  It features my personal favorite character, episode, tribe and moment in the entire series.  It's hard to explain just why this season is so great without spoiling it but I just can't say enough good things about it, particularly the endgame.",10
10.0,Palau,ep6wtpk,"It's dark, it's brutal, it's insane and it's spectacular. However, it is not for everyone and certainly not one you'd want to start with. But for those who're looking for something with a bit more grit, especially with the way the show has gone in recent years, you will want to watch this season. It's definitely not one you'll forget. 10/10",9
10.0,Palau,ep7w903,"Palau is tied for my favorite season ever. It's incredibly unique both in the pre and post merge. It has high emotion, fantastic character development, and a super awesome theme that is integrated into every element of the season. The final episode has a sequence that is the only time I have ever cried watching Survivor. 

However, as others have stated, it's really not a good FIRST season to watch. I think the best order to watch Survivor is chronilogically, but if you can't do that, still watch at least four or five other seasons first so you can appreciate the unique elements of this season.",4
10.0,Palau,ep8gbt7,"This season is fantastic. I fucking love it. **DO NOT WATCH IT AS ONE OF YOUR FIRST SEASONS!** It's great to watch, but it's best to watch it when you have a proper understanding of Survivor. That being said, it's a great season. There are amazing characters, interesting strategy, but the real stand-out is the story. Palau is a dark season, but it's told in an amazing way. It's dark without being uncomfortable to watch. It's the best dark season Survivor has, and it's a must-watch when you've seen a few seasons.

10.0,Palau,ep7dbku,The WWII theme leads to fantastic challenges with a lot of physicality. Palau is one of those seasons that doesn't really have a villain and it doesn't really need one. The despair some of the castaways have to grapple with is enough.,2

10.0,Palau,epauoss,"Palau is my personal favourite non-returnee season from the old school, and it's one that should be watched without spoilers and having seen a number of other seasons first. It's unique in a way that allows its main narratives to play out slowly and engagingly, and build to a huge emotional finish. It's also one of the most real, brutal and personal seasons from premiere right through to finale.

10.0,Palau,ep7lse3,"A horrible season to start first with, since it is unlike any other season.

There are some noticeable flaws with the season; unbalanced editing causing the narrative to be told by a select few people, and the rest being red T-shirts, and a very predictable game from beginning to end.

At the same time, there is a dark, looming theme of the season that is fascinating from a psychology and sociology perspective, and the cast shines through the wonky edit.",4
10.0,Palau,ep7l78h,"I put this season higher than alot of people, but I absolutely love the overall narrative and the military theme.

10.0,Palau,epc05ex,"Highly overrated season. I guess it's better when you don't know the outcome, but I didn't particularly enjoy it my first time either. The premerge builds up the storyline for one character who doesn't end up particularly mattering much in the post merge, where the winner pretty much just steamrolls to the end unchallenged. Some parts of it are narratively compelling, there are really cool challenges, and it has some good character moments, which saves it from being bottom tier.",1

4.0,Marquesas,ep6skyd,"It's probably not gonna finish well in the overall polling but I think this season really is one of the best the series has to offer. I have it at #1 in my rankings, personally.

It's got fantastic episodes, fantastic characters, fantastic narratives, one of the best power shifts in the history of the show (also it's the first one, bonus points) and also has enough strategy to tide over all the strategy fans along with all this great stuff I mentioned above for the people who are a fan of Survivor's storytelling aspects.

I always recommend watching chronologically because it's the best way to watch the show evolve and truly appreciate these older seasons and this season is the biggest argument for doing that. It's fantastic payoff for how the first three seasons played out and you really do appreciate the power shift that much more when it happens.

It's also got my favorite character in the history of the show, the first true example of the ""growth arc"" that we've seen more and more of since this season, as well as the first appearance by one of the show's most famous players.

Overall, fantastic season that I would recommend to absolutely everyone, and a must watch for all fans in my eyes.",22

It’s an almost perfect season, and my personal third favorite.",7

4.0,Marquesas,epdletb,"This season is perfect. It, in my opinion is the most important season in the development of strategy. I cant really go into it without spoilers, but this included a LOT of firsts. Second, this season has one of the best stretches, if not the best stretch of episodes in the history of the show 1-8. The knock on this season is that there is a fairly weak stretch of episodes, which I strongly disagree with. Not only this, but the endgame is fascinating, and includes a racial discussion that eclipses anything that was  thought provoking even in a race themed season like Cook Islands. Watch this season. Its incredible, the narrative is the best ever.

31.0,Cambodia,ep7u2lo,"you should not start with this season. That's because 

1. there are lots of returnees
2. Because of 1, many of the moments inside this seasons are either referencing to older seasons, an act of trying to redeem his or herself, or a affirmation of those player images. 
3. the strategies are often very forward thinking (compare with some older seasons) and considerably meta. It's often remarked as the beginning of a new wave of survivor strategy, where 'fluidity' is emphasis heavily by the unconventional use of alliances. Because of that, You'll need to be familiar with how the game is used to be played to get a better sense of the strategies and the mind of the players. 

With all that in mind, Second chances usually receive mixed opinion. People would often complain it doesn't have enough character moments and focuses too much on the game play. It have it's niches and it does it nicely, so I personally enjoyed it. I just don't think everyone would, especially if you enjoy some of the more wacky moments and older seasons of survivor.",8

In my opinion, this is the best season Survivor ever produced.In the pre-merge, you’ll get to know just how much this means to the players. Every vote out is a gut punch because you know everyone wants this so much. But where this season really kicks into gear is the merge. The gameplay is so intricate, exciting and unpredictable  from one episode to the next that no one is safe. Everyone here is playing the game at the absolute highest caliber, and it leads to a season where the gameplay is unmatched, and seasons after it try to emulate, but none capture quite as well. It’s a divisive season. If you’re looking for human interaction, and humor, you may well be dissapointed. But if you’re looking for high frenetic strategy and gameplay, this season is all you could’ve ever asked for.

It really only has one negative: after you've tasted this kind of playing, it kinda spoils you for regular Survivor with its traditional ""alliances"".

The cast is great, the pre-merge is one of my favorites ever, the challenges are unique and interesting, the relationships among the castaways are unique and complex (one of the relationships in this season spans multiple EP’s and is one of my all-time favorites), and the winner of the season has one of most unpredictable and strangest Survivor journey’s I have ever seen. There is a lull in the gameplay in the early/mid merge portion but it picks up towards the end. Overall, it’s a great season.

Also like Borneo, the cast is fantastic. Numerous players on the show are considered Survivor legends, and for good reason. The show also feels a bit better structured, as you can see Probst improving as a host.

But I have to say, the last few episodes of the season are incredibly boring. I'm in the midst of watching the finale now and they've waisted quite a bit of time on the remaining contestants reflecting on/ talking about the game and how they're sad that they have to vote someone off again.

2.0,"Australian

Action is relatively slow, as the show is still figuring out how to balance the documentary-style nature of early-era reality TV with the need to keep things fresh after a lot of Survivor fundamentals are established in S1. The players feel a bit larger than life in retrospect, as many have returned to play again and become legends, but the simple reduction of some of them to story-telling archetypes ultimately makes the season less compelling than it might have otherwise been. It's not a complex season, but if you want something to have on in the background while you cook and do chores, it works a lot better than some other seasons where you need to be paying more intense attention.",1

(Merely One Strategy obsessed fan’s opinion) The season starts out good, there’s some fun characters, and decent strategy. The cast is fun, there’s something for everyone. Superfans who are there to play, and old school characters there for the adventure. However, the fault that absolutely destroys this season, is the twists, there’s 26 episodes, and 24 players, so some episodes will have a twist, instead of an elimination, to pad out the air time, said twists are terrible, one, flat out ruins the season, resulting in the only time that I have stopped watching a modern season of Survivor due to not enjoying it. I can’t comment on the early merge because of this. The premerge drags on and on, it’s a slog. The worst premerge in Survivor’s history, in my opinion. However, if you stick around to the very end, you will be pleasantly surprised. The finale is, in this fan’s eyes, the best ever episode of this show. I won’t go into detail because it’s sometning that needs to be experienced for one’s self. Ultimately, this season starts well, and ends incredibly, but the middle is absolutely painful. Grade: D+",1

- An overall narrative to the season that has rarely been rivaled, you would find it impossible (edit) ***not to root for the “heroes” of the season.

- A great season to introduce new fans to, as long as the don’t mind *the theme*

The Meh:

- Once the merge sets in, the narrative of the season becomes fairly predictable.

- An over-powered twist hampers some of the gameplay

The Bad:

- Outside of your heroes and a few stand out villians, very few characters are given any depth. Heck, even some of our heroes barely get any screen time. 

- The fact that the producers of Survivor, CBS, and Jeff Probst all had the collective lapse in judgement to create a season where the theme is *the tribes are segregated by race*. Literally who thought this would be a good idea?",6

After around 9 episodes is where things take a dip that I can’t explain without giving spoilers. Once the merge hits, it picks right back up, with some absolutely amazing, chaotic tribal councils, mostly due to the hand of the season’s main villain, who, in my opinion, is one of Survivor’s best. Plenty of great downfalls, blindsides and strategy. If you’re not into strategy, that’s fine, there’s plenty of great characters and story arcs. The main problem with this season is the editing.

A very divisive season. Most people either adore it or despise it with no in between. I am on the adoring side of things. The storyline is dark and deep and almost every single character adds something. Your opinion of this season will likely depend on your opinion of the strategy used this season. It’s fascinating for some, and uncomfortable for others. In this season, religion is used against players , and it’s the theme of the season. This season features 2 returning players so it’s not a good first watch. You feel like you know nearly everyone, and just about every single character is great.

Some people claim this season starts slow, and criticize it for the unfair twist it features at the start. While the episodes aren’t boring, the storyline to start the season isn’t something extraordinary. There’s no immediate “bang” that really starts the season off, it’s more of an expositional start. Even though it doesn't last very long and the start does pale in comparison to what comes later, that's still valid.

But after the first two episodes, this season turns on its head. This is the first Fiji season, so there is more attention given to the location than the later themed ones. There's multiple great villains, as well as moments where the line between hero and anti-hero is blurred. The season even manages to highlight the survival aspects of the show that some castaways struggle with, the disturbing reality of toxic masculinity, and even the difference in off-the-island lifestyles that the castaways lead, and how these adversities play out in the larger scope of the game. Even the side characters are multifaceted...",18

It's also a very mixed cast in terms of strength. There are some great characters here, but there's also fodder characters that you won't remember a week after you've finished the season.

Which is a shame because there is actually some good strategic moments sprinkled in throughout the season. Also, FTC gets pretty nasty with the attacks; there is one in particular which I personally find funny but can be considered slightly racist / classist.

14.0,Fiji,ep6zm3t,"...Fiji also marks the first use of the current iteration of the hidden immunity idol, and at this point in the show, it serves its intended purpose. The idol should enhance the social dynamics that comprise the warfare of tribal council, not replace them. With this iteration of the idol comes strategy on how to beat someone with a suspected idol, and another bit of strategy to counter that. There’s an all-time great tribal council that directly results from a strategic question for which precedent has no answer. Every wishy-washy alliance scene, offhand comment, or callback is greatly enhanced by the dramatic irony that the editors manage to throw in at every possible moment.

And last but not least, the ending is classic, emotional, and perhaps season-defining in the best way possible. It's tied for my favorite season (even though I've given the edge to another season in my full ranking), in part because the postmerge is the single-greatest example of a modern Greek tragedy I’ve seen in any form of media.

I wouldn't recommend this season to be anyone's first, but if you've watched a season that precedes this one, and you have some idea of the strategic side of the game, go for it.

Gameplay: In many ways this feels like a transition from the Survivor middle ages (11-19) to modern Survivor, which is fitting as it's the last of its era. Advantages feature prominently and play a large role in subverting social dominance, though the social game is still important. At the time of watching I didn't have the fatigue with advantages that I would have in later seasons, so I received them well.

Cast: I think the cast was pretty strong, though not fantastic. One character in particular has become a Survivor legend, and it's not unjustified, but I think the edit that gave him way too much airtime is.

To this day I have no clue what dictionary they were reading when they came up with this definition of “Hustler.”  It was obvious that they casted with the intent of re-creating past icons, and the players are well aware of that, and mug the camera in the most shaneless appeals for screentime I’ve ever seen.  

It features some really cool stratgization, but all that gets flushed down the crapper in the finale, where they blatantly put their thumb on the scale.  Survivor is a balancing act between impressing the jury and not getting voted out.  But now, Jeff has decided that the “don’t get voted out” skill is an unreasonable expectation.  What we end up with is one of the most illegitimate winners of all time.

 If you like the “it was all a dream” twist on scripted TV, you’ll love this season, where a last minute twist negates everything you’ve been invested in, and renders all the protagonists’ decisions pointless.  Me, I’d rather watch one where playing real Survivor is rewarded.",3

The social strategy of the game really mattered (and was featured) vastly less than most seasons of survivor. At it's best Survivor works when an ensemble of interesting, dynamic and unique contestants clash against each other and collaborate with each other this season particularly down the stretch didn't feature that whatsoever.

fantastic, edge-of-your-seat pre-merge (because of a strong cast with few obvious early boots - of course it helps if you're a fan of the returnees and care when they're in danger), uncommonly exciting post-merge, great strategy by most players (not to spoil anything, let me just say that they achieve what few other players had achieved before them), and an absolutely thrilling finale that is filled with shocks, joys and disappointments - but those disappointments only remind us that Survivor is not a scripted game and people make mistakes (and pay for them). The editing is appallingly uneven in two specific episodes, but there is a higher purpose for that. 15 out of 18 people this season came to play - and even the other 3 are memorable characters!

Is that to say that there is nothing redeemable? Definitely not.  The two contestants that I mentioned have a huge array of fans and you may end up being one of them.  The twist provides some really cool character moments that we just don't see much anymore.  The gameplay in the early merge portion is pretty exciting, and overall few seasons can beat this one if you are looking for sheer unpredictability.

The premerge is alright, there’s some fun drama, and some great blindsides. Where the premerge really shines though, is the central twist. Everyone, including myself, was apprehensive about this twist but premerge, the twist was very interesting, there’s  a lot of character moments, and genuine reasons to root for the players on Extinction to come back. Where the season really kicks into gear is the postmerge. It is the most chaotic one since Cambodia, big moves, great blindsides, incredible tribals. Sadly, the twist is bad in the postmerge, and it kind of puts a damper on the whole season. The finale really is a special case, there’s some incredible gameplay and moves made. I can’t talk about the ending without giving spoilers, but it’s what keeps the season out of S tier for me. This season definitely isn’t everyone’s cup of tea at all, but it sure is mine.

It was really a weird season, for it goes against many of the conventions of survivor. Not only the rules are very different (with EOE), the editing of this season is also vastly different then what we've come to know and expect of survivor.

Many of the moments in Post-merge are memorable, especially the tribal councils and the idol searching moments. The returnees play their heart out, so does some of the new players. However, the edit focuses on way too much on a few key players. It could make you feel that you don't even know some of the cast members and doesn't gets a full picture of their strategies.

It's sometimes compare with Gabon. In Gabon, everything can go wrong goes wrong, which makes Gabon comedic and fun. In EOE, everything that could possibly go wrong doesn't go wrong, somehow caused an unexpected result (that nothing goes wrong, very unusual for Survivor's standard).

Without spoiling the exact results, the ending leaves a very bitter taste on many people's mouth, mine included. If you are a fan of those returning players, you should watch this season. If not, you shouldn't.",1

After that, it descends into some of the most uncomfortable, unwatchable Survivor there is. One absolutely awful moment isn’t handled well at all,and if it aired today, we likely would get cancelled. It’s a  Shakespearean tragedy where you hope upon hope that one player will betray another, but you know all too well it won’t happen. The only good thing post-merge is the Final Tribal Council and ending, but even that isn’t worth the awfulness you had to watch to get there. If you’re looking for hyper frantic strategy like myself, it won’t be found here, there is, point blank, **none** beyond the basic alliances. This season is tied with Game Changers for my worst ever. Most of Survivor is great television, this one fails at even that.

30.0,Worlds Apart,ep6pb29,"It’s disappointing. Characters are unpleasant and unlikable, people are often mean to each other and if you are rooting for someone, that is not because it’s someone that you like, but because there’s no one else to root for.
Pre-merge is quite solid, post-merge - for me - infuriating. You can try to watch this season, but for me it’s really not worth it.",6
30.0,Worlds Apart,ep6r9kt,I actually think this is a good starter because you end up rooting really hard for some characters and really hard against others. It also isn’t flooded with advantages. It is pretty bitter though and there are some uncomfortable moments.,11
30.0,Worlds Apart,ep87esn,"i havent rewatched this season so my opinions are based on the initial reaction to the vile, bizarre, and dark nature of this season when i saw it in 2015 but as of right now i would urge you to **not** watch this season any time soon. 

some people really really love this season and i feel like on a rewatch i might actually warm up to it but there are parts of this season that i found really difficult to watch mixed with some pretty awful gameplay at times and a group of players that just really werent likable. i feel like WA's winner was fitting but in my opinion is in the bottom 5 winners of all time which doesnt necessarily bring down the season, but doesnt make me want to recommend it.

some of the worst seasons actually produced some of the best winners ever which would lead me to recommend someone to watch it in order to see their game, but when this season is both not enjoyable and doesnt really have a winning game worth watching, i have no reason to tell someone to prioritize watching it. this is definitely at the top of my list for a rewatch but until then, im gonna leave WA at **34/38** with a downvote from me",4
30.0,Worlds Apart,ep9cd4u,"I just finished watching this season for the first time earlier tonight. The pre-merge is good, with lots of fun and quirky characters, but there are also a few awful characters who cast a dark shadow over the whole season and prevent it from being better. The post-merge starts out really slow and eventually gets better as the season's main storyline plays out, and I did find the ending to be satisfying (although that appears to be a point of contention). Overall, I don't love it, but I don't dislike it either.",5

30.0,Worlds Apart,ep6yukr,"I only watched SJDS and wasn't that interested in Survivor but once i saw Worlds Apart live, this season got me hooked and watched older seasons.

30.0,Worlds Apart,ep79o1p,"I believe this is the first season with a theme that actually felt silly. The concept of No Collar is contrived and artificial. However, I got past it.

30.0,Worlds Apart,ep7is0n,other than one or two moments it's not THAT Bad but at the same time there isn't a lot of good either this season I don't find it unwatchable but I don't think I'll be giving this another go anytime in the forseeable future as for you just go in with not SUPER Low expectations but don't exactly go in expecting a good season,2
30.0,Worlds Apart,ep7sq7m,"This is a season I have higher than most people. Alot of people hammer the season for what happens midgame, and while I'm not a fan of that section of the season, there's alot going on in this season that people who hate the season overlook. It has a fantastic pre-merge, and while there are some really unlikeable people in the cast, most of them end up getting eliminated in highly satisfying fashion. And in the end, the overall narrative of the season and endgame is strong as well.

30.0,Worlds Apart,ep85cmj,"While I don't think this is the worst season, it's by far the ugliest and most uncomfortable to watch. It honestly upset me just how awful some of these people were to certain people and, while I do love the winner personally, it did start a future trend in survivor that I feel is destroying what the core game is about. Overall a dreadfully disgusting season that you shouldn't watch unless you wanna get angry and upset.

30.0,Worlds Apart,epbwxc2,"My all-time favorite season. Imagine Vince McMahon was in charge of producing Survivor and you get Worlds Apart. So many over the top villains and characters mixed in with a prototypical All-American hero. This season stands apart for the fact that it seems as if everyone is trying to play the role of the goat to make it to the end. If you like watching Survivor for the villains and idiots, then this is the season for you.",1
30.0,Worlds Apart,epewwp7,"Tons of fun. Great challenges. And a bunch of strategies that were brought to their culmination here. Several things that were hinted to be possible during other seasons come to life here. It becomes very easy to find multiple people to root for or against, and the tension towards the end is palpable.

And this won't spoil anything to anybody who isn't a Survivor superfan, but you have to admit that the FFGC person's epic moment during a certain challenge *alone* is worth the price of admission.",1
30.0,Worlds Apart,ep70b1t,"Worlds Apart has the worst cast of any season. Almost none of the characters are even remotely likable or more than superficially interesting. And when you have a cast this bad, there's no recovering from it. The season starts off boring, then gets increasingly uglier, and eventually features some of the most disgusting words anyone's ever spoken on Survivor.

,,ep7ewuz,"I'm watching this one right now! Will post something here in 3-4 days. Fun but flawed so far.

EDIT.....so yeah, this season is definitely flawed. The biggest problem is that there are 18 episodes and they all are 1 hour and 7 minutes long. Great, you might say, more time for character development. Nope, most - if not all - of the extra time goes to the Captains and their duels. They are both agreeable people, but there is WAY too much focus on them for the little impact they have on the game. The other problem is that *at least* half the cast has little to no game. Some even throw the towel (figuratively) when they find themselves in trouble.

On the positive side, there are a few (like 4-5) casting gems, there is one moment that is as shocking as probably anything you'll ever see on US Survivor, and the final result is both competitive and surprising, given what has happened at the tribal before the FTC.

It's a solid mid-range season.",3

Something good? There are some entertaining characterwz and the location is probably the best ever. Also the gameplay of the winners is arguably the best ever. It also has some funny moments and S05E07 is a really good episode in general.

At time was considered the worst and a season unwatchable. In my opinion, almost all of the seasons Ara watchable to some way, at least for you to say ""I watch all Survivor seasons"". However there is not another good reason to watch it more than that. It's boring, dark, uninteresting and irrelevant overall.

A summary of the general opinion on this season is “AUS 2016 but if the mateship succeeded”.

 An extremely divisive season, that I am nearly alone in liking. 
Due to the twist, it’s a bad first watch, it spoils key moments of earlier seasons, but if you don’t  care about spoilers, it really isn’t that important. Now for the actual review:
There are many seasons some may describe as “slow-burn”. GI is the slowest burn of them all. The premerge is great. Some downright genius bluffs, some entertainingly awful play, and some tragic characters. All of that culminates in what I believe to be the best merge episode there ever was. After this, is where the slow burn starts. There’s a bit of a lull, but there’s some decent moments to be found. All of this culminates in a great, Edge-of-your-seat finale.

36.0,Ghost Island,ep8efut,"This season sucks. There's very few redeeming factors. It has a couple cool characters, but most of them are dull. The editing is shitty and unbalanced. The strategy is boring as fuck. The twist is just an excuse to fill the game with as many advantages as possible. So it fails in execution, editing, gameplay, and characters. It has maybe 4 good characters (so 1/5 of the cast) and a couple good moments, but that's it. It's a great example of the issues with modern Survivor. I would not recommend this season to anyone.

- Several fan favorite characters get a chance to return

The Meh:

- The departure of many of said fan favorite characters in the premerge 

- Inbalance of editing among contestants 

- The addition of so many “also-played” contestants diminishes the caliber of the season

The Bad:

- Far too many advantages/twists/swaps that hurt players you were excited to see do well

- One of, if not *the* most disgusting and malicious act by one contestant toward another. I still cannot watch that scene without feeling sick to my stomach.

- The characters the editing chooses to focus on are drier than sand paper. 

- Those fan favorites mentioned above nearly all leave with their legacy tarnished or diminished 

- Pretty much everything, seriously don’t watch this season",6

Changers",ep7gcjs,"If you’ve seen my Cambodia review, you know I loved it dearly. This season was an attempt to replicate that great season, albeit with more prolific players. And really, that’s where the first of many problems lie here. Some of the cast are straight up legends of the game, some are people who even the biggest of fans struggle to remember. The premiere is honestly incredible, 2 hours of nonstop action, if you enjoyed the main characters antics in their other seasons, you’ll immensely this episode. The rest of the episodes are very good as well, lots of character moments, great gameplay, and colorful characters. Where we start to go downhill, however, is episode 6. Others will explain why E6 is so awful better than I, but E6 is in my opinion, the worst thing to happen on camera on Survivor.  Overall though, premerge is one of the best in the show’s history, so how can such a great premerge lead to an awful season? Well,The main problem is that the main storyline that happened on the island is completely edited out! It was very dark, personal and compelling, all of that is left on the cutting room floor for a completely bland, uninteresting post merge that’s completely boring and culminates in an awful finale.

This season is epic but for the completely wrong reasons. I still have no idea why someone thought it was a good idea to mix the biggest legends of the game, with people who belonged on a second chance season. I still maintain that many people hate it because of the boot order but I can't be objective it because I'm one of those people. If you're a fan of the show, GC asks you to kindly fuck yourself right off a cliff as you get to watch your favorite players get annihilated to make way for the most boring final 3 of any full-returnee season.

the boot list is one of the worst ever and while the pre-merge is amazing it basically wipes out everyone worthy of the title (albeit a few) and basically leaves the game wide open for the winner to steamroll their way to the end with ease. it was an impressive game to watch from the winner but a very boring one at that which is why i have GC at **27/38**

1) Returning Players. This season features 2 very controversial players from past seasons, both of which are very experienced and dominate the air time while there. They are incredibly experienced and this makes the cast unbalanced. 

2) The Twist. Redemption Island allows voted out players to return to the game via challenges. It takes up a lot of time each episode, and most agree it goes against the crux of Survivor. 

3) The Characters. Most are either bland or unlikeable. The ones that most agree are the worst get the most focus. Others are completely forgettable. There’s some truly uncomfortable moments, while these moments don’t go quite as low as AS and GC do, they’re still cringeworthy.
